     After a fine career, his father
     Ah, he had loved a love that never
     ``A humble sinner, Dimitry Larin,
     ``Akulka'' the onetime Selina,
     Alas, it's not so hard to guess!
     Alas, on pleasure's wild variety
     Alas! the generations must,
     All flourishing; they send their duty.

     All right, you want the resurrection
     All this has now gone out of fashion,
     Alone amid all his possessions,
     Along the fronts of darkened houses,
     Already Olga's hand was gripping
     Always our fervid hero tended
     A man who's active and incisive
     And Eugene? half-awake, half-drowsing,
     And all the while the moon was shining
     And every morning I awake
     And here my sentiments impel me
     And he was loved... at least he never
     And home was now their destination;
     And if she happened anywhere
     And now, my friends, I hear from you
     And of the cupboards, one contains
     And our young poet -- Olga fired him
     And someone's heart will feel a quiver,
     And so they lived, two ageing mortals,
     And what's more, they're so supercilious,
     ``Another!... No, another never
     Another page of recollection:
     Applause. Onegin enters -- passes
     As far removed as they were able
     As, lovingly, in his confession,
     A sorry state of things, it's true!
     As soon as he appears, discussion
     A sudden clatter!... blood was curdled...
     At first I thought it out of season
     At first Onegin's tongue produced
     At first, disparity of heart
     At first they called; but on perceiving
     A thinker in a desert mission,
     A thought was born, and quickly noted...
     At least you then showed for my years
     ``At the Larins'!'' ``But how mysterious.
     At this midnight of my condition,
     Away inside that unassuming

     Bards of our tearful generation,
     Believe (as conscience is my warrant),
     Beneath storm's vestment, on the seaway,
     Between them, every topic started
     Books, riding, walks, sleep heavy-laden,

     But God, how deadly dull to sample
     But I myself read my bedizened

     Evgeny, hating litigation,

     Evgeny stood, with soul regretful,

     Evgeny thought in just this fashion.
     Evgeny waits: and here comes driving,
     Exhausted by the ballroom's clamour,
     Farewell the games of golden childhood!
     Fate saved Evgeny from perdition:
     Fired by the god of inspiration,
     Fonvizin8 sparkled, freedom's champion,
     For it was custom that consoled her
     From hour to hour a surer capture
     From that rough spell at last exempted,
     Full of obedience and demureness,

     Happy is he who's known its fretful
     He cursed Theocritus and Homer,
     He'd brought back all the fruits of learning
     He destined Olga's hand for me,
     He'd given up girls -- now gave up letters,
     He drained his glass down to the end
     Heedless of the proud world's enjoyment,
     He followed them without illusion,
     He gave his arm. In sad abstraction,
     He gave three balls a year, and rather
     He lacked the slightest predilection
     He looks, and answers: ``Agafon.''4
     He mounts the sledge, with daylight fading:
     He reads to Olga on occasion,
     Here comes the yard-boy, who has chosen
     Her eyes were opened, and she said
     Her father, kindly, well-regarded,
     Her loving spouse with approbation
     He roamed the world, his lyre behind him;
     Her tender touch had never fingered
     He's always with her: either seated
     He sang of grief and parting-time,
     He sang of love, to love subjected,
     He smiled as Lensky talked: the heady
     He sweetened up with fancy's icing
     He was a good and simple barin;6
     He was sweet-natured, and yet wild.
     He was too young to have been blighted
     He was without that dithyrambic
     He who has lived and thought is certain
     High ceilings everywhere abounded;
     His father died; and (as expected)
     His father failed to understand
     His hair was fashionably curled,
     His life went sailing in calm weather;

     Hoar-frost that crackles with a will is

     ``How did you come to marry, nyanya?''
     How dull are acting and evasion,
     How early he'd learnt to dissemble,
     How early on he learnt to trouble
     How often, when the sky was glowing,
     ``How slow you are at guessing, nyanya!''
     How soft his glance, or at discretion
     ``I?'' ``Saturday. The invitation
        IX
     ``I am in love; leave me alone.''
     I ask you, each and every poet!
     I buttonhole a wandering neighbour
     I can see naught, as Hymen's foe,
     ``I can't sleep, nyanya: it's so stifling!
     I could describe here his attire;
     Idle again by dedication,
     I'd love you, but inside a day,
     I don't know why, but for my friend
     ``I don't see what's so bad about it.''
     I'd still like dances to this day:
     I feel a small foot in my hand;
     I find myself no longer equal;
     I grasp a stirrup with affection,
     I hear you say. But can you see
     I kept in mind an ancient store
     I know, Godsent one, I'm protected
     I know (and seek your exculpation)
     I know it, in the thoughts of all
     I know it's now in your discretion
     I know too surely how it ends.
     I lack the strength required to say
     I liked his quality, the dream
     I'll conjure up that swooning fashion
     I'll feed the journalists for dinner
     I'll float in gondola's seclusion;
     I'll gladden your imagination,
     I'll say: with past ideals in view
     I longed, like every breaker hissing,
     Imagine it: quite on my own
     I'm at your service to protect you;
     I'm blind to every apparition;
     I'm grieving still, but no more tears,
     I might have said a word, and then
     I might have seen you, heard you speak
     I'm much afraid that bilberry wine
     I'm near to sobbing, near to weeping!...''
     I'm old, my mind is blunted, Tanya;
     I'm sick, my dear, I'm sick indeed.
     I must translate -- there's no presuming --
     In French Onegin had perfected
     In backwoods, how d'you pass this season?
     In days of carefree aspirations,
     I never lived or wrote for praise;
     In fact one day a note came flying
     In languid silence, or the flame
     In love with fame, by freedom smitten,
     In such an album, friends, I too
     In summertime -- for he was leading
     In the dark sky, a shooting star
     In the white heat of some dissension
     In time past, objects of affection
     I only write like this, you know,
     I prize the attention of my friends,
     I regularly take much pleasure
     I roam by the secluded lake.
     Is Others' View,5 that clever lyric,
     I see another problem looming:
     I signal to each passing sail.
     I still find Gallicism delicious
     Ist?mina,11 thronged all around
     I suffered once from all the madness
     Italian nights, when I'll drink in
     It all seemed new -- for two days only --
     It baffles me. But I'll repeat
     I thank him without reservation,
     I too -- when I recall Svetlana5
     I trust my fate to your direction,
     It's true, I'll not misrepresent them,
     I've drawn a plan and a projection,
     I've known too many a haughty beauty,
     I've no one here who comprehends me,
     I've run a mile, I must avow,
     I've seen how, trustful in his blindness,
     I've wasted too much life away!
     I walk the shore,17 I watch the weather,
     I was Onegin's friend that season.
     I was just thirteen years of age.
     ``I weep... In case there still should linger
     I weep, and pray for your protection..,
     I would have found a friend, another,
     I would have had the indiscretion
     I write, my heart has ceased its pining,
     ``I write to you -- no more confession
     Just before dinner, from his labours
     ``Just half a glass more... that will do...
     Ladies of such a cast, I think,

     Lensky ingenuously related
     Lensky of course was quite untainted
     Lensky rejoiced. His designated

     Let's go, our friendship's worth the labour!''
     Like convicts in a dream released
     Like modish parquetry, the river
     Listen to me without resentment:
     Lord Byron, with his shrewd caprices,
     Love passed, the Muse appeared, the weather
     Love's frantic torments went on beating
     ``Maidens, pretty maidens all,
     ``Make way, make way,'' goes up the shout;
     Meanwhile another new landowner
     Meanwhile, attired for morning strolling
     Meanwhile my novel's opening section
     Meanwhile with pain her soul was girdled,
     Melmoth,7 whose roaming never ceases,
     Moments of silence, quite unbroken;
     Monsieur l'Abb?, the mediocre,
     More tolerant in his conception
     More wine, he calls, to drench the flaming
     Mushrooms in brine, for winter eating,
     ``My dearest heart, you're sick and ailing.''
     My early bird! you know, last night
     My goddesses! Where are you banished?
     My heart awaits you: you can turn it
     My mind is fuddled.'' ``Tell me, nyanya,
     ``My sweet, God warrants me your debtor.''
     ``My sweet, my dearest heart, I'm old,

     Napoleon's our sole inspiration;
     Neighbours in whispered tones are taking

     Next day Tatyana, early waking,
     No, I was born for peace abounding
     No, early on his heart was cooling
     No ice and flame, no stormy weather
     No madrigals were for inscribing
     No moralizing from this joker;
     No, never in the hottest fire
     ``No, no, I'm sure the party's small.
     No one's, I swear by God! in sadness
     No secret crimes, and no perditions,
     No, soon she changed her old demeanour:
     Not so? ``No, sirs, the ode's the thing,
     Now, Lensky, would it be so bad
     Now Tanya's groaning, now she's sighing;
     ``Now don't suppose... let no suspicion...
     Now here's a letter, as you see,
     Now nearer... hooves... and in the yard
     No word: another day goes by.
     Now, to my cost it may be true
     ``Nurse, I'm not ill; I... I'm in love.''
     Nursed in the orient's languid weakness,
     O Adrian waves, my invocation;
     O Brenta, I'll see you in dream;
     Of Lensky's fate they said no more --
     Of course. Yet fashion's wild rotation,
     Of course, the love of tender beauties,
     O flowers, and love, and rustic leisure,
     Often of course you'll have inspected

     ``Oh nurse, I'm sad, I'm sad, I'm shaken,
     ``Oh nurse, a favour, a petition...''
     ``Oh nyanya, nyanya, I don't question...
     Oh, this could all be false and vain,
     Oh, when, and to what desert banished,
     Olga's adorer comes a-wooing.
     Olga's no life in her regard:
     Olinka and her mother sent:
     Onegin has outrun us all.
     Onegin knew enough to savour
     Onegin, my good friend, was littered
     Onegin's life, you see, was holy;
     Onegin swiftly came to know
     Onegin was assessed by many
     Only the ode, that solemn story!
     On the first sheet you'll find a question:
     On the seashore, with storm impending,
     On whom alone can we depend?
     Our evanescent northern summer
     Our love is what they most abhor;
     Parisian taste invents for one --
     Poets, I'll say in this connection,
     Poor Tanya's bloom begins to languish,
     Porcelain and bronzes on the table,
     Praskovya re-baptized ``Polina'';
     Prepared for prophecy and fable,
     Present me, please.'' ``You're joking.'' ``Never.''
     Princess Alina. She was still
Prisoner.
     Protect me from such apparition
     Proud Albion's lyre is what I follow,
Pushkin's note.
     ``Qu'?crirez-vous sur ces tablettes?''
     Reflection was her friend and pleasure
     Relations. No-one else at all.
     Remember the retort satiric!
     Riding on the lugubrious prairie?
     Rousseau (forgive a short distraction)
     Russia's Terpsichore, shall never

     Schiller and Goethe had refined him,
     Seeing herself as a creation --
     She dropped... ``It's he! Eugene arriving!
     She loved the balcony, the session
     She's dressed since dawn, dead pale; debating,
     She's paid the sunrise no attention,
     She struck one as the incarnation --
     ``She was the one who looked as still
     Should your perfections be expended
     Sign of the urge for domination:
     Silence was everywhere enthralling;
     Since earliest boyhood he had doted

     Softly the door is opened, enter
     So glut yourselves until you're sated
     ``So let it be! for you to keep

     So the poor butterfly will quiver

     So, verse and prose, they came together.

     Spoilt by the habit of indulgence,
     Still in the porch, exhausted-stupid,
     Still tumbling, devil, snake and Cupid
     Such feckless passion -- as I live,
     Such were a young rake's meditations --
     Take Olga's shoulders now -- the beauty!
     Tanya (profoundly Russian being,
     Tatyana breathed on the cold pane,
     Tatyana dear, with you I'm weeping:
     Tatyana flushed, and started shaking.
     Tatyana had a changeling look
     Tatyana had no dolls to dandle,
     Tatyana heard Evgeny out.
     Tatyana, hunted by love's anguish,
     Tatyana in low-cut attire
     Tatyana listened with vexation
     Tatyana, lonely heroine,
     Tatyana looks with pulses racing
     Tatyana lowered her regard
     Tatyana never knew the attraction
     Tatyana now need wait no longer.
     Tatyana shared with full conviction
     Tatyana, sleepless in the dark,
     Tatyana's love is no by-play,
     ``Tell me, our neighbours, are they thriving?
     ``Tell me, what's your companion doing?''
     That point I wouldn't mind contesting,
     That year the season was belated

     ``The Lord God be with you, my daughter!''
     The better to dispel her sorrow
     The bitterness was mine -- the ice
     The censor's tribute, I'll arrange:
     The ch?teau was of a construction
     The city's early sounds awake her;
     ``The elegy's just vain protesting,
     The fields are dark, since evening came.
     The fire was dying; cinders faintly
     The flirt has reason's cool volition;
     The happiness of youth is dead,
     The house is packed out; scintillating,
     The illness with which he'd been smitten
     Their talk, so sound on every matter,
     Then, crying, they untwined my plait,
     ``Then send your grandson with this letter
     Then verdicts from her husband's quartet
     Then what resulted from the meeting?
     Then with a half-ethereal splendour,
     The olden days, I want to hear...''
     ``The one you love's the younger daughter?''
     ``The peasants there have wealth abounding,
     The place where Eugene loathed his leisure

     The rustic sage, in that apartment,
     These figures from the world of seeming,
     The sky breathed autumn, time was flowing,
     The sky is clear, the earth is frozen;

     it's like a vanishing newcomer --
     it's my profession; he was wearing --

     of the most harmless, hopeless trash.

     once on the highway he'd detected
     on dance-floor, at breakup of ball,
     one customary grief each hour!
     one customary object gleaming,
     one finds in war amusing sport,
     one leads the multitude in thought,
     one raves in verse like me, and one
     one sees a duck and aims his gun,
     one thing inspired his breath, his heart,
     on foot, by seven o'clock, until
     on kennels, and on kith and kin,
     on liquor, and on hay brought in,
     only in January the snow,
     only to Eugene showed their worth;

     on stage are thumping without cease;
     on the highroad the wolves come out;
     on this unstable life, my friends!

     on visits to us, and in greeting
     on waves of far niente floated,

     some future dunce will point a finger
     some ladies preach from Say and Bentham,
     some splendid lady is referring
     something like spleen, that scourge of Britain,
     sometimes from a fair, black-eyed maiden
     sometimes, in reverie's sacred land,
     soon, infidelity proved cloying,

     spurs of Chevalier Gardes are clinking,
     spying my features, as he could,
     still as a shadow, grim and bitter;
     still captivated his young soul.
     still coughing, hissing, clapping, champing;
     still everywhere the lamps are bright;
     still shivering in the bitter weather

     that generations of new beauties,
     that king of the satiric scene,
     that, like proud Byron, I can draw
     that, meanwhile, pinched and glum of feature,
     that modish rings were still a-buying.
     that raves with poetry can ever

     that verse will turn to useful duties;
     that virgin dream and its confession

     the abstracted poet would bring forth
     the album of a country miss
     the all?e to the lake, the copse;
     the audience still is busy stamping,
     the ballroom drove me off my head:
     the blood within my withered heart,
     the boxes; boiling, pit and stalls;
     the clamorous honking geese began
     the coachmen ring the fire, and curse
     the coolness of the sombre glade,
     the country's pretty stupid here!
     the darling objects -- don't you know it? --
     the darling sex is light as down.
     the days grew shorter, in the glade
     the driver sits and cuts a dash
     the easier they become to charm,
     the expanse of fields, so wide, so lonely,
     the fleeting works of my creation,
     the footmen sleep on the pelisses;
     the foreign words a maiden's passion
     the full fruit of her heart's desire;
     the gallery claps -- it's bored with waiting --
     the herdsman's horn proclaimed the morning
     the homely scene, take pleasure in it --
     the horse gets wind of them and, snorting,
     the horses fidget worse and worse;
     the idol that she'll most admire

     their hand to grapple slander's cup,
     their southward flight: one saw approaching
     the kiss where youth and freshness gleam;
     the letter from Tatyana's hand:
     the letter trembles in her grip;
     the magic voices of your stream,
     the marriage plans were all exact
     the meaning of an epigraph,
     the merchant's up, the cabman's walking
     themes popular or idealistic,
     the millions of two-legged creation
     then I'd have looked for you alone
     then, country evening fast arriving,
     the needle, never had she lingered
     then liking grew, then every day
     then, stepping nearer, Eugene said:
     then suddenly she's off, and there
     the poet's heart found full expression,
     the prejudices of the ages,
     there Didelot10 crowned himself with glory:
     there caustic Shakhovsk?y8 came in
     there gathered at the coffin-side
     there's no absurdity as such,
     there's no ignoble tale that seems
     there's nothing can employ her anguish,
     there was a general furtive chatter,
     there zerov8 shared the unwilling
     the safest place for declarations,
     the samovar of evening boiled,
     the secrets of the grave, the pages
     these words are not of Russian stock:
     the shady wood, the talking stream;
     the sober head, detesting each
     the stars, the moon -- celestial light
     the total ownership of woods,
     the units are ourselves alone.
     the universe is all perfection;
     the urn of perfumed tea, and tipping
     the usurers' voracious tribe.
     the utter virtue of their being,
     they buried Uncle, congregated
     they while away the morning's calm.
     this was our heroes' conversation
     those words where love, without condition,
     thought, day and night, and thought again
     thoughts of a girl, or as the moon
     through it they're known to me, and kin.

     to A?'s vintage in the sequel
     to Eugene all was new and thrilling;
     to ask of you that you transcend
     to be respected all through life:
     to eat and drink, then separated
     to garden walks, as arm in arm
     to hear what latest modes require,
     to hide a hope, to make a show
     to hope that even once a week
     to lie down at her feet like slaves!
     to life and hope with just a glance --
     to nobody except a wizened
     to pass for cultured in our ranks.
     to pass the evening. No? then tot
     to put on chains for him, and steady
     to save the honour of our land
     to sleep some black and empty dreams;
     to smother her dear feet with kissing.
     to speak; believe me: of my shame
     to the first meanings of his flute.
     tranquillity, and solitude --
     treaties of nations long departed,
     twirls the other slowly as she pleases,
     two hearts, a torch, and a nosegay;
     two verses of the Aeneid.
     unfathomable to the mind;
     unhesitating from her tongue,
     until the grave by your strong hand:
     untouched by envy's bitter smarting,
     upon it, and with head down-bent
     wedlock for us would be abhorrent.
     what flowers of spring display your dint?
     what have your wits to do with me?
     when, in pale sky, the stars' procession
     which smilingly your friend, supported
     while a mazurka holds the crowd;
     will loyally discharge its duties,
     with The Well-Meaner10 on her knee?
     with a blunt cue for the duration,
     with an obeisance I'll hand over...
     with a small tray and a teacup.
     without a trace of spite or plot,
     with such a blissful, brief infection --
     word on his lips, and thought: it's sheer
     years back, to call up many a fable;
     you'd not so much as know the name,
     you gave me such a shocking fright!
     you left no steps that could be tracked:

     He's gone away and left his village,
     He's here -- Monsieur Guillot, my friend.
     He's neither died, nor lost his reason,
     He thought that Olga'd be confused,
     He wakes -- and who is this who writes him?

     I'm yours, in a predestined fashion,
     In Tanya, what a transformation!
     ``I noticed once, at our chance meeting,
     In swarms around Tatyana ranging,
     In the two sisters' rooms extended,
     I pray God grant his soul salvation,
     I put your genius to the test,
     I really dote upon the word:
     I shall set out on brand-new ways
     Is he a Melmoth, a Childe Harold,
     Is it that we've become officious
     Is spleen his trouble, or the dumb

     I thought, she'll go this time, perhaps;
     ``It is a friend I sing, a youthful
     It's agony to watch the hollow
     It's late. A breeze begins to roister,
     ``It's nothing.'' And away he flew.

     It's time: kind-hearted, idle creatures,
     It's time she went. But what can I
     It's time to drop astern the shape
     It's true, the magnet-like attraction
     I've learnt new sadness; but in this
     I've learnt the voice of new ambition,
     I've paid my due to classic art:
     Iv?n Petr?vich still is dumb,
     ``I weep... In case there still should linger

     ``Last night, what made you fly so early?''
     Lensky has watched: his rage has blazed,
     Left-handed from the habitation
     Like modish rhymes that lack all reason,
     Ladies came over, crossed to meet her,
          La, sotto giorni nubilosi e brevi.
     Legends, and mystical traditions,
     Lensky all evening, in distraction,
     Lensky resolved before the duel
     Lensky's thrown down. The murk is thick
     Let me look back. Farewell, umbrageous
     Lost in our backwoods habitation
     Louder and louder sounds the wrangle:
     Love tyrannises all the ages;
     Madame de Sta?l, Bichat,13 Tissot,14

     Martin Zad?ka fails to mend;
     Martin Zad?ka was the siren,
     Meanwhile Onegin starts to languish:
     Melpomene wails long and loud,
     Moscow has beauties and to spare:
     Moscow... how many strains are fusing
          Moscow, loved daughter of Russia,
     Moscow's the place, the marriage-fair!

     No, all in her was calm and plain.
     No answer comes. Another letter
     No answer comes. He goes, for better
     No doubt about it, it's Eugene.
     ``No, every minute of my days,
     No feast, no welcome-gifts -- with fire
     No hope! no hope! He leaves the revel,
     Noise, laughter, bowing, helter-skelter
     No look, no word for him: she's chosen
     No matter; fate's decree is just.
     No one will think that worth gainsaying,
     No path to see: the snow has drifted
     No, she's already pledged her word
     No sleep, beneath that silken curtain,
     No tearstains, nothing. Wrath alone

     November stood outside the door.
     Now Nature's tremulous, pale effect
     Now all was still. Tatyana slept.
     Now brooding thoughts hold his attention
     Now, faced with this enormous revel,
     Now for the first time she's escorted
     Now he's returned, what role's he dancing?
     ``Now march.'' And calmly, not yet seeking
     Now powder's greyish stream is slipping
     Now she's alarmed; in desperate worry
     Now the mazurka sounds. Its thunder
     ``OE'' devotedly inlaced.
     O dreams, o dreams, where is your sweetness?
     Often she halts against her will,
     Of those who heard my opening pages
     Oh, I've no strength... I'm tired, my chest...
     Olga is there, he sees her stand
     Olga's appeared upon the scene,
     ``Olga,'' she thinks, ``what fate befell her?
     Olinka yawned, just like her neighbour,
     Omens dismayed her with their presage;
     On an old aunt, who's long been burning
     Once Vy?zemsky,4 who chanced to find her
     Once home, he brought out and inspected
     Once more he counts the hour-bells tolling,
     Once more he turned to books, unchoosing,
     Onegin comes, and makes excuses;
     Onegin, drenched with sudden chill,
     Onegin, d'you recall the day
     Onegin had no word to say;
     Onegin looks with eyes of fire:
     Onegin -- now once more my theme --
        Onegin's Letter to Tatyana
     Onegin sits at table too,
     Onegin's soul encountered there
     Onegin still is slumbering deeply.
     Onegin's waiting on the ground.''
     Onegin t
     Onegin too. ``Good Lord, at last!''
     Onegin too -- and there to see,
     Onegin turns, and with a shiver
     Onegin wastes, you'd almost find
     Onegin without more ado
     One melancholy fop, declaring
     ``One winter's worth, you've surely got;
     Only Tatyana does not sleep,
     Only from Tanya's heart, no cheering --
     Only the estate provides a setting
     On such indifference, such forgetting
     On these, with something like obsession,
     On this we'll part; goodbye again!
     On this we'll part; goodbye again!
     Or, as by Lethe's bank he slumbered,
     Or from all notion of enjoyment
     Or he knew how to reconcile them
     Or, unconsoled by the returning
          O rus!
     O spring! o time for love! how sadly
     Outside the gate Tatyana parted
     Perhaps however, to be truthful,
     Perhaps some secret apprehension
     Perhaps to improve the world's condition,
     Perhaps, when thoughts are all a-quiver

Pushkin's note.
     Rage died, and jealousy's obsession,
     Reader, I wish that, as we parted --
     Reader, I wish that, as we parted --
     Reader, whatever fate's direction,
     Revenge's hour is near, and after
     Right at the outset of my story
     Risen with earliest rays of dawning,
Russian language against the encroachment of foreign words.
     Russian pancakes were always served;
     Russia's old glories and their gleams,
     Saint Petersburg's fine flower was there --
     Searching the table exegetic
     Seeing Vladimir had defected,
     Semy?n Petr?vich, mean and glum,
     Shade-like, in purposeless obsession
     She dreamt of portents. In her dreaming
     She enjoys the stately orchestration
     She entered the deserted yard.
     She faced him, questioning: ``But you?...''
     She hesitates, and doubts beset her:
     ``She knows you?'' ``Why, we lived next door.''
     She'll not see him, her obligation
     She looked across, felt in her heart
     She looks: forgotten past all chalking
     She's dropped her sash's silken billow;
     She's fallen in the snow -- alertly
     She's here, she spreads abroad; she stipples
     She's in the wood, the bear still trails her.
     She sits down by the window-sill.
     She sits with Nina8 at a table --
     ``She's mine!'' Evgeny's voice of thunder
     ``She's not in love?'' ``There's no one, ever.
     She wanders on without direction.
     She was alone, lit by the moon.
     She went -- and Eugene, all emotion,
     She went -- and Eugene, all emotion,
     Shishkov,6 forgive me: I don't know
     Shot through below the chest -- and streaming
     Since dawn, whole families have been driving
     Since then Martin Zad?ka's spell
     Since when is this?'' ``Two years or more.''
     ``Sit down! how strange! it's like the stage
     Smiling through sleep, nature is meeting
     So Lensky wrote, obscurely, limply
     So down came Tanya, hardly daring
     So let me with a kind expression
     Some neighbours there have come together;
     Sometimes his tricks would earn him trouble,
     So my Zaretsky, as I said,
     So now be off to Neva's brink,
     So there she stood, forlorn, deserted!
     So to his wife for presentation
     Still as he was? has he stopped prancing?
     Still blazing with resentment's fuel,
          Still for ever, fare thee well.
     Straight up the chimney, pipes were smoking.
     Street lamps go flashing by, and stalls,
     Suddenly, from a crest, she sighted
     Tanya begins to understand
     Tanya comes to in utter fright...
     Tanya is gripped. No comment's made
     Tanya looks on; her own indictment
     Tanya pursued them with her gaze...
     Tanya's distress had risked detection
     ``Tanya's no child -- it's past a joke,''
     Tanya's no longer quite so frightened
     Tanya's undressed, and lies in bed.
     Tanya thanks each one with a phrase.
     Tanya to all her kin. My sorrow
     Tanya today goes hurrying out
     Tatyana asked. The children all
     Tatyana groaned above the tide;
     Tatyana hears but takes no part;
     Tatyana, hiding her condition,
     Tatyana in a deep emotion
     Tatyana! it's addressed... to whom?
     Tatyana leaves Onegin kneeling,
     Tatyana looks, her faintness passes:
     Tatyana on; Miss Kharlikova,
     Tatyana pined in secret fashion:
     Tatyana seeks to attune her ear,
     Tatyana sees with trepidation
     Tatyana's haunted by her vision,
     Tatyana's heart is rent in two.
     Tatyana's here, you know I've brought her...''
     Tatyana's husband, now appearing...
     Tatyana's husband, now appearing...
     Tatyana simply lay in bed,
     Tatyana's rites are not for me.
     Tatyana struggles to run out --
     Tatyana turned with thirsting soul:
     Tatyana went with them, and sped
     Thank you for all the gifts I treasure,
     The World found this enough to treat
     The arbitrary rules of passion
     The aunts exchanged a look, they fluttered,
     The banquet's given no cause for sneezing,
     The bearded outrider is sitting
     The book displayed, not so you'd know it,
     The choirs of dancers sought their quarters.
     The clock of doom had struck as fated;
     The comrade of so many days,
     The crush, the heat, as music blares,
     The darkness thins away; but still
     The days flew past; by now the season
     The hall is full of noise and hustle,
     The horses, as they sense the dead,
     ``The house, the park... I'll go and see!''
     The invalid's glad salutation,
     Their look, though, shows no change upon it --
     The jealous poet's gloom is lightened!
     The kinsfolk in concerted action
     The lady of the house has fled.
     ``The morning star will soon be shining,
     Then Tanya hears of the decision.
     Then, after midday he'll be waking;
     Then doors are opened, Lensky enters,
     The nervous-tragical reaction,
     Then gradually upon sensation,
     The night has many stars that glitter,
     Then in return for all this twaddle,
     ``Then, in the backwoods, far from rumour
     ``Then, in the backwoods, far from rumour
     The north wind blows, the clouds are driving --
     Then our Automedons are flashing,
     The old dame had no thought of scouring
     The ploughman there delights to doze,
     The poet's dead... already though
     The princess, sitting peaked and wan,
     There came a murmur, for a fleeting
     ``There, just in front of all that swarm,
     There many pages keep the impression
     There's din of parting now that rages,
     There sings the nightingale, spring's lover,
     There's powdery snow up to her knees;
     There's vacancies in plenty there.''
     There was -- --,10 so notorious
     There was a pine-branch downward straying
     There, with epigrammatic neatness,
     These days I'm finding even gladness,
     The storm is over,5 dawn is paling,
     The tomcat, mannered and affected,
     The two old ladies kiss and cry;
     The vote was passed without demur.
     The world of fashion, prone to flatter,
     They buzz -- but then all talk's suspended --
     The years incline to gloom and prosing,
     The years would pass; no longer youthful,
     They laugh. The guests begin arriving.
     They're settled in; and crawling, sliding,
     They take her too to the Assembly.
     They've missed Eugene's completed etching.
     This dear, still world I must forswear
     ``This is Vladimir Lensky's grave
     This wearisome perambulation
     This work of the profoundest learning
     This world's so vacuous that it's got

          To live, it hurries, and to feel it hastes.

     Yet once for him her thoughts had whirled,

     Zaretsky draws up a convention
     Zaretsky, engineer-in-waiting,
     Zaretsky rose without discussion;

     a ball in Petersburg; but fun
     a bit provincial and affected,

     a brook flows through a grove of lime.

     a carving-knife -- and in the tangle
     accounts were done, a winter outing

     a country house -- and one who still
     a crayfish rides on spider-back;
     across each bush, across each steep,
     across green meadows, dilly-dally,
     across the drift-encumbered acres,
     across the fields, round hill and rock;
     across the plain's enormous room,
     across to her consort a weary
     active, and hopeful, and insistent:

     and watched a different world unroll.

     and what came out? a hairy, tumbled,
     and ``what's your name?'' she asks him, speaking
     and where Terpsichore alone
     and where Thalia, gently napping,
     and where had he arrived from, not
     and where he'd silently agreed.
     and where is love's tempestuous yearning,
     and where's her sister now? and where,
     and while the star still flew, she'd hurry
     and whiskers -- all of this it keeps
     and whist, that's now so keenly f?ted --

     and, with my Eugene, so have I.
     and with no post, no work, no wife,
     and with the decorous throng to follow
     and wrecked the flooring-boards for good;
     and yet by Vergil or Racine
     and yet in her you'd not detect --
     and yet in vain ennui I squander
     and yet so light. All that is real
     and yet so light. All that is real

     an eloquence of fevered strength,
     an idle monk in glum seclusion,
     an inn at each stage of the route.
     an ode in twenty-five cantos.
     an old man saw her as she came,
     a note from Lensky; in between
     another, a more chilling dream,
     another, and his memory's fled
     another of the ball-dictators,
     a novel, vague and superficial,
     a parodistic raree-show?
     apartment where a double glaze
     a passer-by; and on tiptoe
     a patriot, a cosmopolite,
     a place for rest. Eugene alone

     a pretty girl exactly like
     a quilted chamber-robe and cap.

     a rest from toil and all its aches,
     a rest from toil and all its aches,
     a restless urge for change of place
     are we recalled to grief still burning
     a riding whip. Tanya keeps walking...
     a rogue, a slanderer, a poltroon,
     a rooster head, and on the twitch
     around Priam the much-respected,
     around her neck, or when for her
     arrested by the sheer perfection
     arrives, the girl's exhausted gaze,
     (as I've so oft in jest related)?
     as Sadi17 sang in earlier ages,
     as all things did, to bore him; homing,
     as battles go, I've not begun;
     a scream rings out... the cabin's quaking...
     as did the general at her side.
     a secret truth, and at our cost
     a seedling fallen in the earth.
     as fresh as ever, for its graces
     as from their luscious hive go tumbling
     a shadow, null and meaningless,
     a sharp-nailed paw towards her; bracing
     as he descended to the grave.
     as helpmeet in my sad existence,
     as horses whirled him through the dust.
     as if a cold hand squeezed her heart,
     as if beneath her, dark and rumbling,
     as if she'd been profoundly sleeping,
     as if spellbound, Tatyana stands.
     a simple monument is built.
     a single thing to her. His head
     as in the nook he'd sit alone
     ask Tanya out to dine, and they
     asked Lensky: ``Should we start, I mean?''
     a skeleton jerked by a cable,
     as linen's brought for him to wear.
     a slipper, or a magazine?
     as much as in Moscow the proud.
     as much of banquets and the cork
     a soul so innocent, so trusting.
     a soul that nothing can renew...
     a soul that perished long ago,
     as pair by pair the dancers fly.
     a spirit strange, a spirit burning,
     as sacred, lies before me still.
     assembly, silent and dejected?
     as smoke in azure sky disperses.
     as something not to be declared,
     a stall, a kitchen and a fence.
     as the perfection of our days!
     a story that still wants completing;
     as was the old suspicious sage,
     as when chill autumn rains surround us,
     a swift, polite reply is written.
     as yours did, Homer, godlike lord,
     at a friend's word, a girl's caress.

     at fifty, would prolong the story
     at first by Moscow's youthful graces
     at first she had no heart to range;
     at forty he'd have got the gout,
     at heart by grim remorse's freezing.
     at last alone, and quite forgetting
     at last the final hours arrive.
     at length, midst children swarming round him,
     at noontime does his horn resound
     a treasure never to be shared.

     before a fire too slowly flaming,

     before his eyes, imagination
     before my gaze began to pass.

     her golden earrings off and whipping;

     her look, so sweetly sorrow-laden,

     her out-of-fashion turns of phrase,
     her path a hare in headlong flight
     her sacred store of bliss and weeping
     her secret work of magic suasion!

     her soul was waiting... for someone.

     he saw no point in staying on,
     he saw that, as in cities, here
     he's called you out -- say, in your soul
     he scowls -- and the whole gang are still;
     he's dreadfully dissatisfied;
     he sends a letter, penned with passion.
     he sends, a second, then a third.
     he's first to toast her in the bowl,
     he's got consumption. In his anguish
     he's happy, yes, he's almost well...
     he's host, that's obvious. Thus enlightened
     he should have settled for disarming
     he's left sad footprints on the ground.
     he's lost his self-command, and crazed
     he's moved... you see him from the side.''
     he sounds, in lyric frenzy sunk,
     he's put belle Tatiana instead.
     he's racing millward like a bird.
     he steers her, nonchalantly gliding,
     he stoops and, tenderly confiding,
     he's up the steps, with heart a-quiver
     he's viewed the boxes without passion,
     he takes her to a chair, beginning
     he trembles, knows not what to tell;
     he warns his man for duty, stressing

     his bow was wholly unaffected.
     his choice could shock or might offend;
     his collar in its beaver braiding
     his converse gave Onegin pleasure;
     his dull, sick look, his dumb reproach --
     his elegies flow like a brook.
     his foolish face; more pleasant yet
     his gaze at Tatyana alone --
     his head upon her shoulder... blaze
     his heart was plunged! A sudden sound,
     his heart was plunged! A sudden sound,
     his humbly suppliant approach,
     his illness lends him courage and
     his itching verse, Monsieur Triquet
     his life till dawn's already making,
     his lyre, now stilled, in its high mission
     his mind's eye focused on the hinted
     his nature would be changed and steadied,
     his neighbour entered at a rush
     his news has set the party humming!
     his pistols, laid them in their case,
     his serfs rejoicing at their lot.
     his soul still blossomed out, and lighted
     his spindly, shaggy nag. As fitting,
     his sweetheart faithful to her grief.
     his tea with rum quite left behind,
     his thoughts were on a distant goal:
     his thrusting horns, and as he passes
     his virulence that made you smile,
     his weary head, and softly drooping
     his wit, according to the rules
     hope that he's had no time to fashion
     how brilliant with its instant tear!
     however much her soul has faltered,
     however strongly she has been
     how fearful, too, is my obsession
     how long is it?'' ``And since I fed
     how many lines of verse, and themes
     how pleasantly the stages pass.
     how proudly, how divinely gleaming,
     how sad the scar of passion's knife:
     how sensuously her eyes are dreaming!
     how soon the bounds of rank and station
     how they remind me of your stem,
     how to engage in talk that drew
     how well she'd studied her new role!
     humbly I heard your lesson out?
     hymnal as, endlessly unfurled,
     hymns of the ages never sound.
     if I had power to choose your fashion --
     if I had power to choose your fashion --
     if I show wit in jesting thus.
     if her cross mood was at its worst --
     if, motionless, no life appearing,
     if not slow-witted, might have known.

     in your cal?che of foreign cast --
     in your pursuit I've come to know it:
     in your pursuit I've come to know it:
     is ``Kit''3 to every maiden's ear.
     is agony, if I may speak,
     is all those stubborn lips desire!
     is brought to table at full speed.
     is calling us, for ever calling --
     is death, not pain. So gently gliding
     is deep in love, just like a boy;
     is firmly cast. I don't know whether
     is firmly cast. I don't know whether
     is graven on that face of stone.
     is in voluptuous languor dressed,
     is lost in obstinate reflection;
     is on his feet -- in utter stillness
     is out of fashion in our time.
     is represented rather truly,
     is sad old moon's... Hark! snow is creaking...
     is seized by Tambov's poet-sage;
     is that my feet lack strength to go
     is there to lisp its pack of lies.
     is the supreme reward. Precisely,
     is this the man that you were seeking?
     is this the riddle's missing clue?
     is tinsel on a life I hate;
     is tinsel on a life I hate;
     is where old master took up station,
     is with dull trash that can't cohere:
it.
     it brought back Tanya from her trance.
     it can't be youth's distemper -- love?
     it frankly, I'm a firm adorer
     it had its epigram-potential7...
     it hurts, he laughs, and all in vain
     it led him, in these early sessions,
     it may be late, but it's a start.
     it melts, away it rushes, racing
     it's also true, in battle's rapture,
     its barely noticeable stream.
     its due oblivion, in the hush
     its glaring feasts, and shrill events,
     its grip on him, forgot to count
     it's hidden deep in gloom and dust.
     its image, then to swoon before
     it's late, time's passing... not to mention,
     its natural right to rave and flare.
     its newness with our faded days,
     it's new to us, beyond gainsaying;
     it's not in him to bring me bliss.''
     its own perfection everywhere,
     its pristine charm: heeltaps, and leaps,
     its sails go flap-flap as it prances;
     it stirs her drooping soul to bound
     its views, its passions, or its cares!
     it's yes or no, but never sir.''
     it was goodbye, Monsieur l'Abb?.
     it was quite torn in half and breaking.
     it was that he'd been truly stirred,
     jaws masticate as minutes pass:
     jealously, shyly, I've imported
     jointly would tread life's humble way!
     just as she'd always been, she tripped
     just at this crisis of his gale,
     just at this crisis of his gale,
     just look, and never mind the chatter...
     just send your grandson on his way.''

     lest he should by some clever trick
     lest in forgetfulness complete
     lest signs of casual weakness drew
     let evening pass, tomorrow too --
     let fall his pistol on the ground.
     let no more such digressions lurk
     let not the poet's soul of passion
     let's go together, take a rest...
     let's go where, winding all the time
     levy their tribute on the plain;
     lickspittles who adore their crawling,
     lies bright, and vast beyond perceiving;
     lies in a coverlet that ripples
     life's real meaning would have found him;

     like Delvig3 when he's dining drunk.
     like Regulus, that god of honour,
     like a majestic moon, she drives
     like a true friend, to speak my name.
     like fields in spring when storms arrive.
     like foliage in the rotting fall.
     like irksome phantoms, null as zero.
     like mindless youth, the waltz goes by
     like native idiom from their lips?

     she looks, the room is getting light --
     she lost the language of the gods
     she loved the steppe-land and its singing,
     she lowers darkened eyes, unwitting,
     shelter for trysts at every turning;
     she never even bit her lip.
     she never joined, or skipped, but rather
     she once had pined in girlish grief,
     she peers discreetly through a chink
     she quite forgot -- began to call
     she roams the empty garden-plot...
     she sang of childhood's fun, indited
     she sat there; through her teeth a word
     she saw no friendly figure starting
     she sees it all. The simple maiden,
     she sits down calmly on one side,
     she's nearly swooned, she's suffocating;
     she speeds her footsteps to a race,
     she's their great friend, asked in, caressed,
     she stopped at the loud torrent's bound,
     she's turned up in my garden, bringing
     she treads our earth, and how her breast
     she visited the humble tents
     she walked across a snowy plain
     she was unhurried, unobtrusive,
     she went inside the empty shell
     she won't inhale the powdered rime,
     show me the sense. Divine decree
     shows freedom's advocate, that strong
     shows up through trees, all of a grovel
     shutters are opened and the soft
     shutters are up, and all is pale
     silver with moonlight, in her dreaming
     since I'm a member of the same.
     since then my heart was wrenched aside;
     since, through the mist that dreams arise on,
     since, through the mist that dreams arise on,
     sings as he plaits a humble shoe.
     sit on a flimsy bench, and lays
     sits imperturbable, and free.
     sits there beside the window-sill!
     slave of the service, was en route.
     sleep much, read little, and put down
     sleep runs from her, she turns and turns...
     slumber still floats above his head.
     smiles, and a maiden's tranquil poise,
     smoothe his way out with humour's ointment.
     so all went smoothly after that.
     so brilliantly he'd hoax the fools,
     so, cursing women's devious course,
     so effortlessly can disarm.
     so, full of heart-felt tribulation,
     so gloriously he'd fool the clever,
     so heartless and so detrimental,
     so, if we want to change, we can!
     so it was not in any measure,
     solemn, too long compelled to throttle
     ``some are far distant, some are dead''.
     some disagreeable remarks.
     some minutes long. The words won't fit
     some nonsense thrown up while carousing,
some of his verses to him. The stanza was unfinished.
     someone like you and me, just nice?
     someone towards whose heart and mind
     some other, older spring will gleam,
     some regimental bard has added
     something to fritter and to burn,
     sometimes he'd fall into a trap
     some vote a doctor for the case,
     so nearly had them in his power.
     song, laughter, whistle, bark and champ,
     so often from her Moscow cousin
     soon a great truth came to enfold her
     soon all that went without a wrench:
     so pious, and so clever too,
     sorceress-winter's here at last.
     so, seeing there no rhyme or reason,
     so that all three went off to lunch,
     so unforgiving a report?
     so virtuous that, no sooner seen,
     spared her the expense she dreaded most --
     spectacled age divines as well,
     spelt hazard, ruin and disaster;
     spends light and darkness in the dreary
     spread out its shadow all around --
     squeezes her hand -- and brings to flower
     stalking the momentary weakness,

     stands over my poor nurse's tomb.
     stare hard at her before exchanging
     started a life of pointless roaming,
     startling the ingenuous with a jest,
     stays fixed and focused on a vision
     stiffening as the hours go by,
     still after many years in place.
     still dim, through crystal's magic glass,
     still eats and drinks enough for two.

     still has Monsieur Finemouche for friend,
     still made of tulle, the self-same bonnet
     still meek, still deaf as howd'youdo,

     stood in the door, cherubic, mute,
     stood thunder-struck. In what wild round
     stood thunder-struck. In what wild round
     straightened his wig, and asked her name.
     stretched on a sofa, calls to greet them.
     stripping my soul before your eyes!
     struck down as if she'd been accused,
     study where he would sleep and feast
     stuff of the poet's hallowed dreams!
     such careless language of surrender?
     such frank tendresse; away they stole
     such good and sensible advice;
     such rustic cunning can't be wrong!) --
     such shadowy and leisured ways,
     such stubborn brain, and vivid will,

     suspecting wonders would come out.
     swapped it for odd tomes of Malvina,
     sweet as a lover's kiss, and dear,
     sweet old tradition was preserved:
     sweet talk with friends. How many days
     sweet talk with friends. How many days
     sweet words by which her pain was banned --
     swiftly decayed beyond recall

     thank you for sorrow and for pleasure,
     thank you for suffering and its joys,
     thank you indeed. Alike in sorrow
     than this humiliating passion
     than this humiliating passion
     than what our sorrowing rhymesters do?
     that I'm just longing to indite --
     that Lensky and Eugene, apart,
     that Menelaus was quite right --
     that alien scene must I now turn
     that all of Russia can't contribute
     that, artless, and without concealing,
     that corps of social legislation --
     that could sustain it? Only grimness;
     that could sustain it? Only grimness;
     that even so my wretched style
     that fell, and then began to shiver,
     that fiery souls' headstrong enthusing
     that, for all this, my shame's report
     that, for all this, my shame's report
     (that half-pay archivist); and bounding
     that he's not honest past all question.''
     that huge ballrooms vibrated under,
     that lady the hostess was greeting,
     that lady whose engaging charm
     that languid beauty, listens nicely --
     that lives, and glitters, and endears,
     that marble Nina's proved unable
     that mediocre dress alone
     that moment, of a luscious pie
     that night, in secret, set for two;
     that nubile maid of riper age,
     that once I spent my happiest days?
     that one be shot just anyhow --
     that on the world's staircase there waited
     that poison brew; and in your mind
     that poisonous worm, despised, degrading,
     that queen of secrets and of sighing.
     that rogue, backbiter, pantaloon,
     that sat above the stove and purred
     that she's ``ideal'', begins preparing
     that she's so trustful, and imbued
     that somehow that same day we'll meet...
     that soul without a moral tie,
     that spring with me has had its fill
     that's the morass, I beg you note,
     that stretched from Romulus in his prime
     that strikes him with such force and meaning?
     that's where my years of youth were spent.
     that table where the lamp has languished,
     that there his friend Kav?rin's5 waiting;
     that, though polite, was clear as ice.
     that visitors must be expected.
     that was less clever still by half.
     that we enjoy equating chatter
     that wicked, loose-tongue chatterbox...
     that wit embarrasses the dull;
     that with him to the trysting-place
     that world where every man's a critic
     that your proud glance is sure to take!
     that youthful heart. ``But now at least
     that youthful soul, which pined for sadness;
     the Major's here: he's all the rage
     the Muses' lofty arts and fashions,
the Neva.''
     the Russian for le comme il faut.
     the altar flame's extinguished now.
     the ancients have gone stiff and cold,
     the answer's past all human viewing,
     the ardent author of the past
     the art he'd studied best of all,
     the bank, the immobile stream are levelled
     the barbs that envy's always spreading,
     the bear explains: ``my cousin's here --
     the bear has raised her in his paws;
     the bear let out a roar, and held

     the beauties in their flimsy dresses,
     the best revenge one could desire.
     the big room, further, not a cat.
     the blaze of candles, and the trembly
     the bleeding tongues, the tufted tails,
     the bliss that fills me when your throbbing,
     the blood came smoking from the wound.
     the bloom has withered on the bough;
     the books then underwent inspection...
     the boring wives, the ill-bred men,
     the branches all are weighted down
     the branches of the oak with flock;
     the cabinet behind the door
     the carriage of the newly-wed.
     the charm of what was grave and plain.
     the children spoilt, the mad, the rogues
     the circumstances of his capture
     the climacteric of our life,
     the clink of rowels, met his hearing;
     the clink of rowels, met his hearing;
     the coach has reached its destination;
     the cold perfection of the sky,
     the cooks prepare the midday meal;
     the country cottages and hovels,
     the crash of plates and knives is blended
     the crown of marriage was projected
     the crush, the glitter and the gladness,
     the days that doom has measured out.
     the deeper in the wood, the more
     the doorway opened wide to meet her,
     the downy woods are greener-tinted;
     the draught whose blessings are agreed,
     the eager players are enrolled --
     the earlier griefs are what I miss.
     the early pealing of the bells
     the earth for him grew dumb and closed?...
     the elegy, grown paralytic,
     the enjoyment of a friendly drink,
     the entire story of your fate.
     the eyes of all, the hooves, the snozzles,
     the faces met with everywhere;
     the fateful diet; by depression
     the fear and rage with which I foam!
     the festal name day has begun.
     the first will never find fruition,
     the flaming roses of a cheek,
     the fleeting tenderness that stole
     the flickering tones of dress and speech,
     the floor serves Triquet for his nap,
     the foes, cold-blooded and unspeaking,
     the fools who sparkle far and wide,6
     the friends' salute she never hears
     the frozen corpse, drives off, and homing
     the funeral monument explains:
     the giddiest hope, carefree and gay,
     the gift of recognizing what
     the girl he'd scorned in what he deemed
     the girl remains there in the gloom
     the girl's attentive eyes are bent.
     the girl's pale charms, her loosened hair,
     the girls sing out the ancient rhyme:
     the glare, the fumes in which I live,
     the glare, the fumes in which I live,
     the grand barouche is on its way.
     the grand monde finds it out of place.
     the grey-haired nurse with kerchiefed head;
     the guardian angel of tradition,
     the guests are feasted, good and hearty,
     the guests squeeze closer to the centres;
     the hall's without a living creature,
     the hapless Phrygians all the same,
     the happenings of the previous night;
     the hare who from afar has seen
     the hat, the scowling brow, the chest
     the headpiece-text is thus indited --
     the heartache that they bring lies deep.
     the heart and all its fragile dreams.
     the heart inside him seemed to shrink;
     the heart of the professional flirt!
     the heavenly lights in glorious quire
     the hero's name's decided too.
     the highest circles are a bore.
     the horns, and the moustachio'd nozzles --
     the horrid nightmare must portend
     the horror of disgrace and crime,
     the hostess cries and, moving fast,
     the hour was late. And now from aching
     the household boys in noisy rout;
     the hunter in the wood will swear
     the impatient conqueror was humbled!
     the imperturbable princess.
     the inevitable silly asses,
     the infant year with cheerful greeting:
     the inmost thoughts that girls can hide.
     their breed would (some years after this)
     their cloaks; Zaretsky's measured off
     their hands are dipped in scarlet gore,
     their hopes, their pranks, their dreams at night --
     their journey took them a full week.
     their looks and language in deceit
     their masters' berries undetected
     the iron figure3 on the table,
     their table, and their hours of leisure?
     their unattractive t?te-?-t?te;
     the jagged flint's pulled back anew.
     the jams appear in little dishes;
     the joys of youth, that festal cup,
     the jug of bilberry wine is seen.1
     the keys that opened up the hall.
     the ladies' calculated dress;
     the latest fashions of the town;
     the laurel in the old man's crown!
     the leather rein, to learn the tale,
     the legatee of his relations --
     the level tenor of his going,
     the lies that in the press run rife,
     the linen stretched on the tambour.
     the logs; the wild ones have the floor;
     the lover of Julie Wolmar,3
     the lucky bard, and as he dozed
     the lust for blood drew them apart?
     the maidens all are slumbering deep.
     ``the mail explains the time he's taking.''
     the man of honour and of sense.
     the man of reverie and reflection,
     the man she feared and idolized --
     the man who laid her brother low.
     the men confront them, face to face:
     the moderns rage against the old.
     the modesty of her condition,
     the modish Record Office clerks
     the moon; but in the darkened glass
     the moon in its azure of air.
     the morning after, a surprise
     the morning light no longer lingers,
     the mountain maiden,19 my ideal,
     the murmuring Nereids recite,
     then Lensky moved his pawn, and took,
     then afterwards, alone, at ease,
     then dress...
     the neighbour... you must tell the brat
     the new ballet he should be at.
     the new moon, horned, on her left side,
     then from his cabinet he'll pass
     then from the Muse there came revival:
     then he began to talk once more
     then he'd implore a declaration,
     then, help me God, she caterwauls:
     then he presents her with the scroll.
     the nightingale's begun to sing.
     the nightly luminaries climb.
     then in the study's quiet setting,
     then know that your reproving finger,
     then know that your reproving finger,
     then later slyly he'd revile them
     then on the leaves of recollection,
     then quickly something changed all this:
     then quietly at last says she:
     then sudden fear attacked Tatyana...
     then to the altar, to be crowned.
     the occupations of the morning.
     the odious bear still grunts and lumbers.
     the old dame wept her daughter's parting,
     the one who killed the youthful poet?''
     the only face to shake and pass
     the other, jugs of applejack,
     the pain, the grief, the marrow-freezing
     the pangs with which his heart was troubled,
     the party waits. Seized with an illness
     the pensive Dryads' hiding-ground.
     the pillars of the turnpike-gate;
     the poet struck down by his friend!
     the potholes make the coach unsteady.
     the prince bring up his own relation
     the prince looks at him, and replies:
     the programme of his daily round.
     the quintessential reaction
     (the reader thinks the rhyme is lilies:
     there any friend of harmless pleasure
     the regimental band is coming,
the relative merits of the classic ode and the romantic elegy.
     there'll be a fight. For that I give
     there never fails a kindly greeting,
     there's a small window shining in it,
     there's crashing, rumbling, pounding, trotting,
     there's far too much of contradiction,
     there's not a word she's understood;
     there's yap of pugs, and laughs, and bustle;
     there waited for us both the malice
     there was a softness in his glance:
     there was no trace to be detected
     the ring of marriageable girls --
     the sad beginnings of his life
     the same as any other day.
     the secret of her husband's measure,
     the shades of night within their keeping
     the shepherd, as he used to do,
     the shepherd sings of Volga's fishing
     the silence when our talk had ceased!
     the simple legend -- then a haze
     the skyblue eyes, the flaxen tresses,
     the sky is brilliant in its blue
     the snow from all surrounding hills;
     the solitude of woods and tillage,
     the source's chattering voice is heard;
     the spring invites you to the land
     the spring of honour, and the pin
     the strangeness of her habitation,
     the strophe over which I slaved;
     the subtle spouse was just as loyal --
     the sufferings of tempestuous passion;
     the swarm, the glittering mob that presses,
     the talk of guests when they appear;
     the tears in stream pour down her cheeks.
     the third day, wood and hill and grazing
     the thirst for work, the lust for learning,
     the thought of volatile renown.
     the thought sank in, and penetrated:
     the thoughts of my two anchorites.
     the threshold's thronged, wet-nurses call,
     the time to go has long since passed
     the tolerant Evgeny heard --
     the toll of those borne off by fate!
     the tongue of love and of Petrarch.
     the towers of whitestone Moscow beaming
     the trail the youthful poet followed
     the tusks, the corpse's finger-nails,
     the two foes stand with eyes downcast.
     the unmetric verses of tradition
     the untiring city, where you've given
     the unworthy husband through depressing
     the vales dry out, grow brightly printed;
     the valley's dark. The forest lands
     the vital force gives them the shoot
     the war, the snowfall, and his wife.
     the whole thieves' kitchen flies asunder,
     the wild rose blooms, and in the covert
     the wilful fancies of the heart.
     the wine-addict adores the cup:
     the winter's ways are smooth as glass.
     the world and all its works, she wept
     the world's ?clat, its thunder-roll,
     they all have richly earned a pension;''
     they all have swarmed into the hall,
     they all still keep their old impress:
     they'd just enrage it with their dart.
     they don't deserve what they inspire
     the year, his age, then: ``may your rest,
     they find her somewhat unexpected,
     they fluff her curls out in the fashion,
     they heap up silver with a spade;
     they kill the zest of rhymed composing,
     they leave their shores and fly away.
     they managed to disperse the pack.
     they needed kvas like air; at table
     they nudged Tatyana, and each muttered
     the young hostess, towards whom each
     the youthful votary of rhyme
     the youth of those past days in line
     they praise the Father of the world.
     they're on the dance-floor, waltzing, spinning.
     they're plunging, whirling, all but squatting.
     they shared their days in deed and heart,
     they shove each plate, and every chair,
     they sit, they cross themselves for grace.
     they talk of her, of how and whether:
     they took offence at this, and broke
     they've moved around and been reseated;
     they were her only food... and so
     thickly the exclamations fly.

     this modish whirl, this social story,
     this very day I'd gladly give,
     this very day I'd gladly give,
     those walks amid the gloom and calm
     though I'll come back to him, yet clearly
     though Menelaus, in Helen's name,
     though cold I am and sad; in sleep
     though he's unknown, there's no suggestion
     though some support it with good grace).
     though there he's no more to be found,
     thought them a pointless peccadillo;
     though we... don't shine in any way,
     though what's romantic here I simply
     though years ago I used to look
          thou, my Svetlana!
     threats, vows, and simulated fears,
     three carts -- traditional procession --
     three pairs of handsome ones -- yet there
     threw Eugene at her feet -- she stirred,
     thrives to this moment, in a station
     through baseness of the soul that he,
     through distant regions of the heart...
     through gloom and mist; and there came streaming
     through him is sweetness' self. In grumbling
     throughout the boredom of the hours --
     throw meadows into muddy rout,
     thumps as the balls are pressed inside
     till Moscow, meekly on its knees,
     till now our language -- proud, God knows --
     time was, in evening hours of leisure,
     time was when morning's breeze was swaying
     to Eugene; nineteen to the dozen,
     to Eugene's letter, word for word.
     to Evgeny. Oh, God, she'd never...
     to Moscow settled in a trice.
     to Olga's face, he whispered low
     to aim, at steady, even pace
     to all that's trivial and inane?
     to all that's trivial and inane?
     to all the most adored actrices,
     to a soir?e. ``My God! to her!...
     to battle further with my passion;
     to bee and butterfly unknown.
     to bellow out: ``she's mine, she's mine.''
to be mentioned in so offhand a way''.
     to blow his brains out, but in stead
     to boom, to flash across the sky,
     to bring across Lepage's4 mortal
     to burn -- and then by force of reason
     to captivate, and then to fly.
     to catch the eye and to attract.
     to clasp your knees, and at your feet
     to come back to the hall alone
     to comfort her in all her woes,
     to cool my glances and my tongue,
     to crack between them; for a while
     to demonstrate some signs of reason:
     to do them all is easy game.
     to drain its beaker down, nor thought
     to drain, on credit, bottles three.
     to draw a breath, around her staring
     to dreaming given up unduly,
     to drive the swooning senses mad;
     to drop all that old-fashioned mumming;
     to drown the hiss of modish wives.
     to each and every raving feast
     to encase herself inside a layer
     to expose to Moscow fops and Circes
     to face him now I feel too frail...
     to fashion's absolute dictate,
     to feasts and fun this winter past;
     to fresh grandparents every day.
     to gentlemen on every side
     together they arrived, and none
     to give you honest explanation.
     to happen long ago, dear readers,
     to hear him howl: ``that's me!'' You'll get

     to his mysterious tree the snake

     to lift his pistol up. A span
     to meet a black monk, or if crossing
     to meet his thirsty lips... What daze,
     to meet the unhappy poet, skipped
     to me so simply, with the fires
     tomorrow just like yesterday.
     to mourn for Russia's gloomy savour,
     to my young days, it's time I turned

     to raise the safety catch and strain
     to reasoned talk, no dull hearsay,
     torment of pride? And why's he come?
     to roar of banquets, din of brawling,
     to scorn the men with whom he deals;
     to see life as a ritual play,
     to see my kin, and in the end
     to see the grave, and shed a tear.
     to see you, faithfully to follow,
     to sing of others must imply
     to sob out prayer, complaint, confession,
     to spoil loose paper by the ream;
     to steal away her neighbour's light
     to stem the bloodstream's wild outburst;
     to talk as if with heart unwrung,
     to talk of this and that, but then
     to talk to her, but language died.

     two cupboards, one divan, a table,
     two or three novels where our later
     two pines have tangled at the root;
     two poles that ice had glued like plaster
     two sisters who'd received the initial,9
     unanimous exchange of looks
     under the table's linen shield,

     unseen, already you were dear,
     unspeaking, too, but stretched out there
     unswerving friend, correct landowner,

     until the dawn beneath her pillow.
     until this day, a lady's love
     untirable, at sound of drum:
     untouched by trace of inhibition,
     upon her feverish tongue; the slip
     upon her lips the breathing dies,
     urbane betrayals, and the chilling

     using overt or covert rules.

     was asked around as quite a catch --
     was brought there by a huckster who
     was by forebodings much oppressed.
     was far from happy with his role.
     was finding leisure's vacuum cruel;
     was his absorption in their sense.
     was just created for the part.
     was one who raged and raged again,
     was quite beyond his wit, we found.
     was still mysterious and enticing --
     was stripped away, and mists encroaching
     was that calm brow of one who swooned.
     was the first thing that Olga said.
     was the sad poet not confounded
     was undiscovered to that day.
     was younger still, but at that stage
     watched sun and clock -- then by such labours
     watch for your smile, and catch your gaze
     watch the games we maidens play.''
     we'd better hasten to the ball,
     we'll draw it deeper in our net;
     we'll go with her to that delicious

     were you in love when you were young?''
     we sometimes like to hear again
     we visit them, or without fail
     we weep for the young lover's end,
     we were swept off, in reverie's haze,
     what London calls, with humble duty
     what dream accounts for her distraction?
     whatever you may need, just call...
     what feelings would assume control
what he can do.'' Nabokov.
     what held me was my predilection,
     what holds her in profound reflection,
     what is he? Just an apparition,
     what it's transported to our shore
     what kind of thought, what observation,
     what moves along the hidden ways
     what occupied his chafing powers
     what odes Vladimir might have written --
     what play will he present this week?
     what's in them? All this loud parading,
     what's in them? All this loud parading,
     what's more, I loved you; but my hunger,
     what's more, I loved you; but my hunger,
     what store of riches it imparts!
     what traps he'd set him, with what malice
     what was it in your heart it found
     what was it in your heart it found
     what wings our first successes gave!
     when Br?guet's chime is heard proclaiming
     when, from behind the doorway, hidden
     when galloping at headlong pace
     when he arrived; not in the slightest:
     when hourly we ourselves betrayed it,
     when in the park, in the all?e
     when little notes come on a tray.
     when night patrol's a perilous calling;
     when, on the plain, green herbs are massed,
     when our Zaretsky met his eyes.
     when our sublimest aspiration,
     when suddenly I saw this treasure
     when we begin to talk of verse);
     when we see him from afar,
     where Tanya now confronts Eugene.
     where admonitions are pronounced,
     where are distress, commiseration?
     where are the reveries this time,
     where a sharp nail has made a dent.
          where can we find your equal?
     where civil treacheries are rife,
     where did that glum eccentric go,
     where dwelt this child of inspiration,
     where every day a bloodstained shade
     where fate had fixed our confrontation,
     where flows a little glittering brook,
     where folded arms are tightly pressed.
     where her security's complete.
     where he was master of his college,
     where, in a cab, and furious hurry,
     where in the heart of silence rang
     ``where master used to sit alone.
     where nowadays I'm soundly trounced,
     where shall he go, my rogue, my hearty?
     where (standard rhyme) are youth and fleetness?
     where's the high aim, the ardent sense
     where the prize-boy of fashion's college
     where two old pinetrees stand united:
     where you were born as well, I think,
     whether from heaven or from hell,
     whether it goes careering past,
     which Ovid sang, for which the bard,
     which has recalled, without precision,
     which held him silently subjected,
     which with a blush he leaves unread.
     while dear Tatyana's youth grows dimmer:
     while floors would split from crash of heel,
     while in the hut a girl is singing;
     while, marmot-like, he hibernated --
     while men, all sombre, all the same,
     while odes have high and noble aims...''
     while she's from top to toe surveyed;
     whisper repeated to the crone.
     whispers some ballad of the hour,
     whither does all my yearning tend?
     who all his life would garner praise
     who early died as die the brave'' --
     who else? -- the hero of our novel!
     whoever you may be, a friend,
     whoever you may be, a friend,
     who, in good time, would calmly get
     who in the country spends her summer,
     who in the dark came flashing through
     who late at night are whirled away
     who'll clap an entrechat, or scoff
     ``who loves you more than I, let's see
     whom shall we never find a bore?
     whom thirty centuries have adored!
     who never learnt how dreamers babble;
     who never scorned the social rabble;
     whose heart on dreams was wont to thrive,
     whose memory will preserve for me
     whose serfs are miserably thin;
     who sets me snoring then and there --
     who swaggers in with the reply.
     who walks with sorrow, and with danger,
     who was it that you dreamt about?''
     ``why, Olga's younger, and she's bedded.
     why fight what's known to be decisive?
     wild as a forest deer, and fearful,
     will anger you in its confession.
     will blossom into splendid highways:
     will give you a complete reply.
     will halt her horse and, gripping tightly
     will in a flash decide his lot.
     will in my soul be hushed and dying.
     will reach, and past the tomb's compound
     will the benighted reason smile,
window-panes, departed  female owner (the soul being  feminine  in Russian),

     wished him to come and say farewell.
     wishes his madness to the devil,
     with Eugene frozen where he stood.
     with Eugene proved a tempting prize.
     with Guillot; while pourparlers last
     with Olga, all have pierced her soul;
     with Tolstoy's2 brush, or decorated
     with a Venetian maiden who
     with a consumption, they've relied.
     with a first click, the catch is tried.
     with all our hearts, and who require
     with amber pipes from Tsaregrad;12
     with a quick look perusing lightly
     with balm of prayer my torn and rended
     with bended knees a windmill dances,
     with brilliant conquests by the shower,
     with broods of children of all ages,
     with bursts of passion from the heart,
     with care Zaretsky stows away
     with careful schemes of decoration
     with combs, and steel utensils serving
     with comedies of swarm and din;
     with deeds; that dunces now and then
     with deep emotion looks about
     with demoiselles of riper age;
     with draughts from love's enticing flask,
     with each nuance of wintry glow:
     with every different kind of rabble...''
     with every sort of home possession:
     with eyes aflame Onegin rises
     with eyes of love, with greed to swallow
     with fire from every cross of gold.
     with fond caress? whose adoration
     with foppery and too much starch,
     with fright, she hears the approaching bear;
     with gown and slippers; tearing hurry,
     with grave goodbyes to the bereaved,
     with her own forests and her meads...
     with his forefathers would seem better;
     within her bosom to abate,
     with jealousy beyond all measure
     with lampions studded all about
     with lies and jokes that packed a punch:
     with lines to mark where they were sleeping...
     with love and comfort in your meaning,
     with me to see an alien strand;
     with neighbour Lensky, the deceased.
     with old Anisia. The next day
     with our Mamas, and a sensation
     with our poor girl was kind and good;
     without a goal on which to fix,
     without an elegiac frill,
     without a word Tatyana leant
     without preliminary feeler
     without surprise or rage... his laden,
     with parks and mansions, open up.
     with passion and with shrewd obliqueness
     with perturbation and with worry;
     with pleasure on his vengeful act.
     with pots and basins out of mind,
     with puzzled and confused regard...
     with recent fortune, vainly waited
     with sheer enchantment fills her cup!
     with shelves of books deployed for action,
     with sighs unconsciously regretful.
     with spinning noise and senseless flashing
     with tears, in quarters of the maids:
     with the grand general in her wake --
     with the pink glow the snows assume
     with the resounding chime of glass.
     with the unmistakeable sideview
     with this the hero of my tale:
     with thoughts of him in ceaseless round.
     with trees decked in their silvery kit,
     with tufts of snow; and through the lifted
     with visions of enchanted night,
with which XXXII ends, is Pushkin's own contribution, a sample as it were of
     with work at home; but when he'd gone,
     with years no more to meet our gaze?
     with young Semy?nova,9 and there
     won't even cross their minds by stealth...
     words mispronounced, thoughts ill-expressed
work.
     works where contemporary man
     would Hymen bring us -- blooms that might
     would be allied to him by fate;
     would bless the form his fortune took.
     would cause widespread remark and tattle,
     would cause widespread remark and tattle,
     would fill Tatyana from afar
     would have been all that we required!
     would have been spared this laceration.
     would have divined the tender, shrinking
     would launch into self-sacrifice;
     would leave her dithering and tossing.
     would not have recognized again
     would on those evenings guess the fate
     would say goodbye and drive away,
     would settle, on the morrow morning,
     would talk, keep silent, laugh, then frown --
     wound that had seared my Tanya's heart!
     wronged always in disgraceful fashion --
     yes, even there its triumph grows.
     yes, focus on them your lorgnette,
     yes, in that spring-time, in low-lying
     yes, these were our forefathers' ways,
     yet dared not trust what I could see.
     yet floods of talk around the town...
     yet he fell out of love at last
     yet people's malice and suspicion
     yet, truthfully and not in chaff,
     you acted well, that dread occasion,
     you acted well, that dread occasion,
     you age, and life's just grief and sadness...''
     you called there twice, and since then took
     you help him to an honoured fate
     you in my arms on gingerbread?''
     you kept your friendship with our friend:
     you learn life's sweetness, and with this
     you'll never leave me to my fate.
     you'll read: here's Pradt,7 here's Walter Scott!
     you'll recognize him soon enough, --
     you made me drunk as one could ask!
     you newborn work, and like a winner
     young Tanya first appeared to me,
     young Tanya first appeared to me,
     young poet, be for ever blest!''
     young traitresses by the platoon,
     you object of my guileless ditties!
     your Tanya's image in your mind,
     your Tanya's image in your mind,
     your Zeus, your Cypris, your whole band
     your advent swamps me in its flood!
     your battles, lawless and atrocious,
     your chorus, is it dead for ever?
     your cold discourse, were less unkind --
     your cold discourse, were less unkind --
     your dashing one, is she surviving?''
     you're all in fever... heavens above.''
     you're really going? Well, I'm sad.
     you're sure to find her portrait in it:
     your feet, to pale and waste... what rapture!
     your heart some self-restraint; for each
     your heels will squash the ladies' toes! >
     your heroes, raging and ferocious,
     your icy look, your stern dissuasion,
     your icy look, your stern dissuasion,
     your loved one, honourable reader!
     your matchlessness, to seek to capture
     your presence aches, and in my blood!
     your pride, some answer, or in truth
     yourself too long from social life.''
     your soul displays, in holy dreams,
     your tears would flow -- but your emotion,
     your words, and in my soul to explore
     you see the two in uniform...
     you see, with tears and incantation
     you see, with tears and incantation
     you see your fated tempter stand.
     you sought -- tumultuous recollection,
     you sought -- tumultuous recollection,
     youthful, who ripened in his time,
     youth's choice, the flower of French cuisine:
     youth which has nothing to regret,
     you took an honourable part --
     you took an honourable part --
     you've paid insanity its due.
     you were the first ones he forswore;
     you won't find that quite so much catch...
