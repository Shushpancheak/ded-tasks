     I would have chosen none but you
     I would have found a friend, another,
     I would have had the indiscretion
     I write, my heart has ceased its pining,
     ``I write to you -- no more confession
     Just before dinner, from his labours
     ``Just half a glass more... that will do...
     Just let yourself be your whole care,

     Lel6 floats about above her head;
     Lending his tone a grave inflection,
     Lensky composed in autograph
     Lensky disliked the entertainments
     Lensky had a curt word to say
     Lensky has watched: his rage has blazed,
     Lensky ingenuously related
     Lensky of course was quite untainted
     Lensky rejoiced. His designated
     Lensky, restored to his manorial

     Like convicts in a dream released
     Like modish parquetry, the river
     Like modish rhymes that lack all reason,
     Listen to me without resentment:
     Longtime inside this modish cloister,
     Lord Byron's portrait on the wall,
     Lord Byron, with his shrewd caprices,
     Lost in our backwoods habitation
     Lovelace, or Grandison, or neither;
     Love passed, the Muse appeared, the weather
     Love's frantic torments went on beating
     Love tyrannises all the ages;
     ``Maidens, pretty maidens all,
     Maidservants on the beds just now
     ``Make way, make way,'' goes up the shout;
     Meanwhile Onegin starts to languish:
     Meanwhile another new landowner
     Meanwhile, attired for morning strolling
     Meanwhile my novel's opening section
     Meanwhile the news of Eugene coming
     Meanwhile with pain her soul was girdled,
     Melmoth,7 whose roaming never ceases,
     16  Millyonaya, a street  parallel to the Neva, and one block away from

     Next day Tatyana, early waking,
     No, I was born for peace abounding
     No, all in her was calm and plain.
     No doubt about it, it's Eugene.
     No, early on his heart was cooling
     No feast, no welcome-gifts -- with fire
     No ice and flame, no stormy weather
     No, incorrect and careless chatter,

     No moralizing from this joker;
     No, never in the hottest fire

     Now all was still. Tatyana slept.

          O, never know these frightful dreams,
     Only Tatyana does not sleep,
     Only the estate provides a setting
     Only the ode, that solemn story!
     On such indifference, such forgetting
     On the first sheet you'll find a question:
     On the seashore, with storm impending,
     On these, with something like obsession,
     On whom alone can we depend?
     Or, as by Lethe's bank he slumbered,
     Or he knew how to reconcile them
     Or, in your lonely homestead, moping,
     Our evanescent northern summer
     Our love is what they most abhor;
     Outside the gate Tatyana parted

     Poets, I'll say in this connection,
     Poor Lensky! Set aside for weeping,
     Poor Lensky! where the tomb is bounded
     ``Poor Yorick,'' said he, broken-hearted:

     Present me, please.'' ``You're joking.'' ``Never.''

     Sbogar,8 mysterious through and through,
     Schiller and Goethe had refined him,
     Seeing Vladimir had defected,
     Seeing herself as a creation --
     Shade-like, in purposeless obsession

     She dreamt of portents. In her dreaming
     She dropped... ``It's he! Eugene arriving!
     She entered the deserted yard.
     She folds the page, lays down the plume.,
     She hates a friendly voice's sound,
     She hesitates, and doubts beset her:
     ``She knows you?'' ``Why, we lived next door.''
     She'll not see him, her obligation
     She looked across, felt in her heart
     She looks: forgotten past all chalking
     She loved the balcony, the session
     She's dressed since dawn, dead pale; debating,
     She's dropped her sash's silken billow;
     She's in the wood, the bear still trails her.
     She sits with Nina8 at a table --
     She's paid the sunrise no attention,
     She struck one as the incarnation --
     She was alone, lit by the moon.
     She was like him and always sported

     Tatyana groaned above the tide;
     Tatyana had a changeling look
     Tatyana had no dolls to dandle,
     Tatyana heard Evgeny out.
     Tatyana, hiding her condition,
     Tatyana, hunted by love's anguish,
     Tatyana in a deep emotion
     Tatyana in low-cut attire
     Tatyana! it's addressed... to whom?
     Tatyana listened with vexation
     Tatyana, lonely heroine,
     Tatyana looks with pulses racing
     Tatyana lowered her regard
     Tatyana never knew the attraction
     Tatyana now need wait no longer.
     Tatyana pined in secret fashion:
     Tatyana sees with trepidation
     Tatyana shared with full conviction
     Tatyana's heart is rent in two.
     Tatyana's here, you know I've brought her...''
     Tatyana, sleepless in the dark,
     Tatyana's letter, treasured ever
     Tatyana's love is no by-play,
     Tatyana's name day celebration.
     Tatyana's rites are not for me.
     Tatyana turned with thirsting soul:
     Tatyana3 was her name... I own it,
     Tatyana watched the moon, and floated
     Tatyana went with them, and sped

     The fields are dark, since evening came.
     The flirt has reason's cool volition;
     The happiness of youth is dead,
     The house is packed out; scintillating,

     Their talk, so sound on every matter,
     The manor house, in deep seclusion,

     The world of fashion, prone to flatter,
     The yard was bursting with dependants;
     They laugh. The guests begin arriving.

     Was she the Tanya he'd exhorted
     We all meandered through our schooling
     We all resemble more or less
     We each enjoy a special hobby,
     We each have enemies in this world,
     ``Well, I won't hold you up or bore you;
     Weltered in tears, and sorely smarting,
     We must confess that taste deserts us

     ``What, Grandison? oh, Grandison!
     What? Invitations? Yes, three houses

     What breasts! What soul!... We'll go one day

     Whatever for caprice of spending
     ``What in the world is more distressing
     ``What nonsense, Tanya! in those other

     When comes my moment to untether?

     When out to burst a rival's bubble,

     Yes, youth divines, in giddy madness,
     Yet Tanya's note made its impression
     Yet -- fear itself she found presented
     Yet hissing froth deals a malicious,
     Yet once for him her thoughts had whirled,
     Yet sweeter far, at such a time,
     You'd never class her as a beauty;
     You husbands, deeply I respect you!

     You'll love again, but you must teach
     Your curiosity is burning

     ``You're wrong.'' ``But what I wonder at

     Zaretsky bit his lip. Eugene
     Zaretsky draws up a convention
     Zaretsky rose without discussion;
     Zaretsky watched, and stood there grinning.
     Zar?tsky, sometime king of brawls
     a Lancer -- how she deified him!
     a Lancer wooed and won her hand,
     a Russian family's old traditions;
     a Russian hammer-blow, repairs
     a ball here, there a children's party;
     a blank default would suit me better.
     a blessing from its blasts and rages,
     a book of household calculations,
     about one thing, till our next meeting.
     about them -- nineteen to the dozen --
     about what's buried in the past:
     above a stream the moon had lighted.
     above the dust of his remains
     above the water started tracing
     a brook flows through a grove of lime.
     accounts, shaved forelocks,4 Sunday bath;
     a cheerful glimmer on the snow
     a corpse on boards was all he found,
     across each bush, across each steep,
     across green meadows, dilly-dally,
     across our snows of northern bleakness
     across the Baltic in exchange
     across the drift-encumbered acres,
     across the public's toes; he steers
     across the stage; he yawns: ``Ballet --
     across to her consort a weary
     acute and subtle -- in a word
     addressed to Onegin''... ...'Well, that's easy.
     a deathless murmur from within,
     a deft arrangement to his hair,
     adore the love that comes in dream.
     adorning all its country ways.
     a dream's mute monument, reflection
     a dumb moon, on a dumb horizon.''
     a faster, stronger pulsing start.
     a fisher's fire. Through country gleaming
     a flimsy bridge whose every quake
     a flood on which no frosty band
     a fop, a punter on the cards,
     a frequent question: ``tell me who
     after Saint Chariton's gone past
     after that, supper's served, and so
     after your drive, it's quite back-breaking;
     a furious, boiling, heaving main
     again I see your soulful flight?
     against each other swift, small feet.
     aged Derzh?vin1 saw and blessed us
     ages we'd never heard of love:
     a grain of gladness; tears' repression
     a great attraction to conversing.
     a grizzled Calmuck stands to meet them,
     a gulf has gaped... Says Tanya: ``I
     a haze in me, but I grew used

     a hidden beauty in the end:
     a house, a village, and a wood

     a lady -- what a grim discussion! --
     alarmed by my melodious lay,
     album and stays, Princess Alina,

     all plunged his soul deep in the stream
     all sorts of hopeless appetites;
     all these are charming! but to put
     all was material for transcribing:

     along the street where slumber drowses,
     already silvering all the plain...
     already stirred him as they should.
     already tends too much to smile
     already there she stands beside him;
     already yawned before the show,
     although it's nearly heard the knell,
     although one in no manner shares
     although there are no streets, no cards,
     always before the volume ended
     always contented with his life,
     always monotonously gay,

     and the majestic, antlered royal,

     and then a drozhky's clopping sound
     and then a stroll in Letny Park.
     and then, indoors the livelong day,
     and then sat silent all the way.
     and then, with an enchanting grace,

     and useful goods of every kind.
     and walk, and breathe, before I tell
     and warmed the Chinese teapot; flowing
     and washed its face, to her brought word
     and wasted life's fine flower meanwhile.
     and watch your daughters closer yet,
     and what came out? a hairy, tumbled,
     and when its waters were not showing,
     and, when one's least prepared for it
     and where had he arrived from, not
     and where most surely notes are sped.
     and where the husband, recognizing
     and with a halting, trembling gait
     and with a yawn took up his pen,
     and with his dinner, and his wife.
     and, with it, forced renown to come --
     and with its feeble glow outlining
     and with no post, no work, no wife,
     and with the decorous throng to follow
     and wore his dressing-gown to dine.
     and yawn in silence at the stage
     and yet a distant admonition

     a nightingale, in forest gloom,

     an ode in twenty-five cantos.
     a note from Lensky; in between
     another, a more chilling dream,
     another, and his memory's fled
     another bard1 in exaltation
     another, freakish one, who stays
     another's grin was sly and shifty,
     another's joy, another's breast,
     a novel graced with such a name.
     a novel in Lafontaine's8 manner...
     a novel on the established line
     anticipates a swim, in stead
     an urge to sleep; soon, clear as clear,
     any Madonna by Van Dyck:
     a park, enormous and neglected,
     a place for rest. Eugene alone
     a plain, unceremonious troop,
     a portrait with a charming touch;
     appears offensive or amusing
     a pretty girl exactly like
     a quilted chamber-robe and cap.
     a rambling walk beside my lake,
     are bound, by every virtuous wife,
     are coloured in a single tone,
     a red-foot goose, weight something fearful,
     are entered here, in friendship's gage,
     are just as nimble as their feet.
     are old times, and the servants' hall.
     a restless urge for change of place
     are treated to the fullest rigour
     a riding whip. Tanya keeps walking...
     as I have... learn from my belief
     as all things did, to bore him; homing,
     a saucy kib?tka is slicing
     as bonneted Academician
     as by the shortest way they flew,
     as did the general at her side.
     a seedling fallen in the earth.
     as fate's mysterious purpose burrows,
     as files, and scissors straight and curving,
     as gage of all things that were good,
     as gay as morning and as clear,
     a shambling hoof along the way;
     a sham that trustful souls work out;
     a sharp-nailed paw towards her; bracing
     as he descended to the grave.
     as helpmeet in my sad existence,
     as horses whirled him through the dust.
     as if some goal had been achieved.
     as if spellbound, Tatyana stands.
     (a simile of this and that)
     a simple Russian family night:
     as infant sleep, or the unaffected
     as instituted long ago.''
     as it assembles them around;
     asked Lensky: ``Should we start, I mean?''
     as love's technique, when it would blare
     as much as in Moscow the proud.
     a soul of sympathy and grace,
     a soul so innocent, so trusting.
     a soul that nothing can renew...
     as sacred, lies before me still.
     as scarlet heels have lost their name
     as smoke in azure sky disperses.
     ``as sung of old, in years of glory,
     a stanza villainously padded.
     as the perfection of our days!
     a story that still wants completing;
     a stride on Petrarch's path, allayed
     a suite of elegies that, throbbing,
     as was the old suspicious sage,
     as well-read, though of pedant cast.
     a swift, polite reply is written.
     as youthful sinning, or the strains
     at Cleopatra, hiss her off,
     at a friend's word, a girl's caress.
     at any hour escape his cell.''
     at any other sort of book.
     at any time he'd be prepared.
     a tear for him... but what's to weep?
     at earliest morning out she started,
     at eighteen years, to some compassion.
     at feasts, was strong and fancy-free?
     at fifty, would prolong the story
     at first Madame gave him tuition,
     at first she had no heart to range;
     at first, with God knows whom to see,
     at last alone, and quite forgetting
     at last the final hours arrive.
     at least by a regretful kindness;
     at least her tone is sometimes found
     at my famed portrait and will say:
     at noontime does his horn resound
     a tomb, a Cyprian shrine's invented,
     a true companion to the end,
     a truly noble disposition;
     at the Academic Diction-book.
     at thirty, lucratively wed;
     at this betrayal's fateful news?
     attract the sneering of the jealous,
     at twenty, was a fop inbred,
     at two-ball billiards prove his skill;
     audacious tunnels will be marching:
     a vulgar touch. I can't translate.
     awaits him -- hears nobody coming.
     battling along that watery freeway,
     became like brother knit to brother.
     became their scrutiny's concern.
     become a joke to us, its game,
     becomes a horse for all to see;
     be doomed to feel it: there's one goal
     beds, bridges, lawn, she never stops,
     befitting such a noble pile:
     before Onegin there collected
     before him roast beef, red and gory,
     before it was the golden play
     before she goes, she seeks permission
     before the fire a table's spread;
     before the window taking station,
     before which life's horizon yet
     begs your indulgence -- it's been spun
     behind the mill. In solemn talk,
     believes in her elected dreaming
     below a hill; a garden stood
     below the others who have signed
     beneath bird-cherries and acacias
     beneath it, vapour wreathed and coiled.
     beneath the stone reposes here,
     beside his heavier half is snoring.
     beside the window-sill, that bed
     beside unfinished lines, a suite
     beyond a string of dull tableaux,

     brushes on thirty different scales;

     burst to a fiery blaze in season?
     but Eugene's out from din and press:
     but I refuse to chop or change.
     but I've not got the least intention
     but Olga would have never read!

     but ladies' hands are not for kissing;
     but meanwhile let him live, and think
     but now it bores me every minute.

     his mind, so cold and so precise.
     his parents' patriarchal dust

     in darkness in her room, or treated
     in deepest grasses, quite alone,
     in dreams and cards and their prediction,
     inexorably wed to duty,

     now sensitive, and now carefree,
     no years of absence past returning,
     objective of his thoughts and joys:
     of Bogdan?vich's11 refrains.
     of Dian's visage, in our fancies
     of Gulnare, he would play a card
     of Richardson and of Rousseau.
     of a delicious, guiltless dream...
     of aunts and mothers, and the thrall
     of blind Fortuna and of men
     of calculated slander should,
     of calm and reason, when the flame
     of childish pranks: a chilled reaction
     of children, though as young as they,
     of course! you're bidden there next week.''
     of eloquence, and just the same
     of entertaining the half-dead:
     of every funeral far and wide;
     of fallen glory. Well! don't wait,
     of gossip, and set comment humming
     of grammar, Russian language too.
     of his Och?kov7 decoration!
     of hope is somehow still surviving
     of hope sometimes disturbs my heart;
     of human friendship, holy men,

     of inexperience would have passed,
     of innocence: a lily blooming
     of instant thoughts, a fleeting trace
     of jealous girls, devote its strain?
     of jealousy, to seem to tremble
     of kindling smiles in ladies' eyes.
     of ladies' heads, and ladies' feet;
     of light that flowering fields reflected:
     of listening like a judge-supreme
     of many distant lands he sang
     of mind got clarity new-found;
     of mocking turn, or else a breeder
     of neighbouring owners of the earth --
     of old-lime hospitality.
     of passion's out, and its whole manner
     of pity for my wretched state,
     of powers unripe, or on the wane,
     of reason's icy intimations,
     of recompense beyond endurance,
     of simple product supplements it.
     of sleeplessness, faint inspirations,
     of something vague, some misty clime;
     of tales of girls, and ghosts, and lore:
     of the Terpsichorean foot.
     of trumpet, dagger, mask and sword,
     of virgin fancy, and again
     of work made him feel sick, and still

     on Eugene, he was deeply stirred:
     on Olga; from heart's ache still spared,
     on Richardson gone raving mad.
     on a fast stallion from the Don,
     on a small table's oilcloth sheen
     on ballroom's looking-glass parquet
     once I too liked it very much;
     once more Corneille's majestic story;
     once more that touch is fiercely troubling
     once more the love, once more the smart...
     once on the highway he'd detected
     on dance-floor, at breakup of ball,
     on dining-chairs are all prostrated;
     one customary grief each hour!
     one customary object gleaming,
     one pair! I pay them memory's tribute
     one smoothes the pillows down in bed,
     one thing inspired his breath, his heart,
     on foot, by seven o'clock, until
     on jam, and speeches in regard
     on kennels, and on kith and kin,
     on liquor, and on hay brought in,
     only in January the snow,
     only to Eugene showed their worth;
     on me, all this has no effect:
     (on orders which of course presume
     onset of the incipient yawn,
     on springtime grasses of the field,
     on stage are thumping without cease;
     on the highroad the wolves come out;
     on this unstable life, my friends!
     on tragedy; but it's no joke,
     on visits to us, and in greeting
     on waves of far niente floated,
     on words of foreign derivation,

     or servants waiting on her pleasure.

     out of the hand of that same bard:
     outside and in they star the night;
     over his neighbour's plain memorial,
     over the Petersburg pav? --
     over the note holds in suspension
     pale transcript of a vivid master,
     panes patterned by the finest printer,
     parodies winter in the south;
     parterres, she runs to rivulet's brink,
     passion's rough language talked by others,
     penates, came to cast an eye
     peopled my sleep, and to their theme
     perfervid language of the bard,
     perfidious blow to my inside,
     perhaps -- for flattering hope will linger --
     perhaps, though Phoebus warns, I'll see
     perpetually, one goal for dreaming,
     persisted and made no amends.
     plunged in reflection's deepest train,
     poetic dreams, a brighter fire.
     poetic in her simple pureness,
     poor Tanya more intensely burns;
     pretty maidens, romp away,
     products of carefree hours, of fun,
     promptly had nothing left to give.

     ready to share our quiet leisure
     really more bearable to you
     rebuffed, found instant consolation;
     recalling earlier loves, did we,
     recalling earlier time's romances,
     reduced to sense, not without pain --
     red wine in tumblers to the brim --
     relations off, and never spoke.
     reluctant to exhaust the boy,
     rendered them tedious to each other;
     resigned disposal of your fate.

     retired, forgotten by his brothers,

     sadly he mourned for the departed.
     saw through the window, morning-bright,
     scarcely recalled their love, their spite;
     screened by a hill from storm's intrusion,
     seared as by fire, she stopped. Today
     secretly overheard by you.
     secret sledge-rides in verse of fire;
     self-portraits only -- furthermore
     sentiment, notebook, verses, all

     sets the wise traveller cavorting

     sharpness of wit, and social art,
     she blossomed in the graceful ways
     she calls down curses on their leisure,
     she'd never join the game selected,
     she'd never tell them news or scandal
     she fell in love -- the hour was fated...
     she fell in love with all the fancies
     she found Evgeny, eyes a-glitter,
     she grew accustomed, and contented.
     she lacked her sister's beauty, lacked
     she'll spin this way and that, and beat
     shelter for trysts at every turning;
     she never joined, or skipped, but rather
     she quite forgot -- began to call
     she sang of childhood's fun, indited
     she sits with head sunk on her breast,
     she spins and, friend of winter nights,
     she's up and flying through the air
     she trembles, and with fever drumming
     she walked, but just as she was turning
     she yields to it without condition
     shocked by their modish pride, and fleeing

     simple old lady; but the liquor --

     sing about something else at last!''
     singing in chorus as directed
     sits with Limburg's vivacious cheese
     sleep much, read little, and put down
     sleep runs from her, she turns and turns...
     smiles, and a maiden's tranquil poise,
     smile, voice and movements, little waist --
     so a storm-shadow wraps away
     so fires of spring will bring to birth
     so, full of heart-felt tribulation,
     so long as they're employed in song:
     some future dunce will point a finger
     some regimental bard has added
     something like spleen, that scourge of Britain,
     something to rack his brains about,
     sometimes, in reverie's sacred land,
     so much, I'm left no time to speak!
     soon all that went without a wrench:
     sooner or later will relate
     soon, infidelity proved cloying,
     so sketchily possessed by each,
     spectacled age divines as well,
     spread out its shadow all around --
     spurs of Chevalier Gardes are clinking,
     spying my features, as he could,
     still after many years in place.
     still as a shadow, grim and bitter;
     still captivated his young soul.
     still coughing, hissing, clapping, champing;
     still everywhere the lamps are bright;
     still filled with Eugene, Tanya wrote,
     still shivering in the bitter weather
     such careless language of surrender?
     such crystalled scents as best are able
     such rustic cunning can't be wrong!) --
     such shadowy and leisured ways,
     surer than friendship or than kin,
     suspecting wonders would come out.
     swam on the river's dreaming face,
     sweet as a lover's kiss, and dear,
     sweet old tradition was preserved:
     take any novel, clearly traced
     than households where the wife must moan
     thank God, he had no inclination
     than what our sorrowing rhymesters do?
     that I prefer to Champagne's tide;
     that all of Russia can't contribute
     that ardent youth entirely lacks;
     that even so my wretched style
     that fills him and in which he lives.
     that fired his soul, to burn the same;
     that from the backdoor he'd be leaving
     that generations of new beauties,
     that king of the satiric scene,
     that, like proud Byron, I can draw
     that modish rings were still a-buying.
     that once I spent my happiest days?
     that poison brew; and in your mind
     that queen of secrets and of sighing.
     that raves with poetry can ever
     that sat above the stove and purred
     that's where my years of youth were spent.
     that there be just one voice which came,
     that there his friend Kav?rin's5 waiting;
     that thievish mouths cannot consume
     that verse will turn to useful duties;
     that virgin dream and its confession
     that visitors must be expected.
     that was less clever still by half.
     that world where every man's a critic
     that youthful soul, which pined for sadness;
     the Corsair, or the Wandering Jew.
     the Lord have mercy on us all!
     the Muses' lofty arts and fashions,
     the Russian N, like N in French;
     the all?e to the lake, the copse;
     the ardent author of the past
     the atmosphere of youth and madness,
     the audience still is busy stamping,
     the blood within my withered heart,
     the books then underwent inspection...
     the boxes; boiling, pit and stalls;
     the brilliant crackpot: this reaction
     the charge that poets are unable
     the charm of what was grave and plain.
     the clamorous honking geese began
     the coachmen ring the fire, and curse
     the country's pretty stupid here!
     the crown of marriage was projected
     the crush, the glitter and the gladness,
     the cunning prisoner can quite well
     the darling objects -- don't you know it? --
     the darling sex is light as down.
     the days grew shorter, in the glade
     the easier they become to charm,
     the entire story of your fate.
     the fateful diet; by depression
     the fleeting works of my creation,
     the flower-like pallor of the maiden,
     the footmen sleep on the pelisses;
     the gallery claps -- it's bored with waiting --
     the gift of recognizing what
     the guests are feasted, good and hearty,
     the heartache that they bring lies deep.
     the heart of the professional flirt!
     the herdsman's horn proclaimed the morning
     the hero's name's decided too.
     the homely scene, take pleasure in it --
     the horse gets wind of them and, snorting,
     the horses fidget worse and worse;
     the idol that she'll most admire
     the indifferent, or the deadly serious!
     the inevitable silly asses,
     their guests, for all they ate and drank,
     their joyous way across the ice;
     their looks and language in deceit
     their lords, and thwack their palms together;
     their masters' berries undetected
     their southward flight: one saw approaching
     the jams appear in little dishes;
     the jug of bilberry wine is seen.1
     the ladies' calculated dress;
     the latest fashions of the town;
     the laurel in the old man's crown!
     the letter trembles in her grip;
     the lover of Julie Wolmar,3
     the magic voices of your stream,
     the marriage plans were all exact
     themes popular or idealistic,
     the mountain maiden,19 my ideal,
     then I'd have looked for you alone
     then, country evening fast arriving,
     then dress...
     the new ballet he should be at.
     the new moon, horned, on her left side,
     then from the Muse there came revival:
     then liking grew, then every day
     the noise their rustic wheels projected --
     then on the leaves of recollection,
     then suddenly she's off, and there
     the other, jugs of applejack,
     the pages of some dull review,
     the pain, the grief, the marrow-freezing
     the peaceful Muses' devotee,
     the pensive Dryads' hiding-ground.
     the poet's heart found full expression,
     the programme of his daily round.
     there Didelot10 crowned himself with glory:
     (the reader thinks the rhyme is lilies:
     there any friend of harmless pleasure
     there caustic Shakhovsk?y8 came in
     there gathered at the coffin-side
     there's far too much of contradiction,
     there's no absurdity as such,
     there's no ignoble tale that seems
     there waited for us both the malice
     there was a general furtive chatter,
     there, where the coulisse entrance went,
     there ๑zerov8 shared the unwilling
     the rosy bloom that glowed so newly
     the rosy sealing-wafer's drying
     the roundest face that you've set eyes on,
     the samovar of evening boiled,
     the season which is such a bore --
     these words are not of Russian stock:
     the silence when our talk had ceased!
     the simple faith of olden days
     the skyblue eyes, the flaxen tresses,
     the sober head, detesting each
     the strophe over which I slaved;
     the subtle spouse was just as loyal --
     the sufferings of tempestuous passion;
     the thought of volatile renown.
     the thought sank in, and penetrated:
     the thoughts of my two anchorites.
     the tighter we can stretch above them
     the tongue of love and of Petrarch.
     the total ownership of woods,
     the uncertainties within his heart;
     the universe is all perfection;
     the unworthy husband through depressing
     the urn of perfumed tea, and tipping
     the usurers' voracious tribe.
     the utter virtue of their being,
     the wilful fancies of the heart.
     the world's ?clat, its thunder-roll,
     they buried Uncle, congregated
     they don't deserve what they inspire
     they leave their shores and fly away.
     they met on horseback; quickly they
     they needed kvas like air; at table
     the youthful lover once again
     they took offence at this, and broke
     they were her only food... and so
     they while away the morning's calm.
     this child of luxury and delight.
     this denizen of the coulisses
     this was our heroes' conversation
     those monkeys of the good old days:
     though cold I am and sad; in sleep
     thoughts of a girl, or as the moon
     thought them a pointless peccadillo;
     though years ago I used to look
     three pairs of handsome ones -- yet there
     through distant regions of the heart...
     through heaven's expanse serenely flying,
     through it they're known to me, and kin.
     through the back porch runs out and flies
     till then had been dispersed and wasted --
     times were when I was sharp and bold:
     times were, when master's least suggestion...''
     to A?'s vintage in the sequel
     to Eugene all was new and thrilling;
     to all the most adored actrices,
     to all this tattle, yet at heart
     to bee and butterfly unknown.
     to be respected all through life:
     to be the bride I'd call my own.
     to blow his brains out, but in stead
     to catch the eye and to attract.
     to drive the swooning senses mad;
     to drown the hiss of modish wives.
     to eat and drink, then separated
     to freedom, softness and enjoyment:
     to garden walks, as arm in arm
     together they arrived, and none
     to hear what latest modes require,
     to hide a hope, to make a show
     to high renown my doleful story,
     to horror-stories told at night
     to kissing or caressing father
     to life and hope with just a glance --
     to life grew colder than the dead.
     to me so simply, with the fires
     tomorrow just like yesterday.
     to nobody except a wizened
     took her to his estate, where she,
     too weak to change, I'm staying vicious,
     to pass for cultured in our ranks.
     to play with a dishevelled tress,
     to rains, and flax, and the stockyard.''
     to sleep some black and empty dreams;
     to the beginning of our days.
     to the circle of our dance.
     to us, though, not exactly new.
     to vice, while virtue got its crown.
     to whom your hearts are dedicated,

     tribute of tears, applause's shrilling,
     tries out the ice with cautious tread,
     twirls the other slowly as she pleases,
     two cupboards, one divan, a table,
     two hearts, a torch, and a nosegay;
     under the table's linen shield,
     unfathomable to the mind;
     until the dawn beneath her pillow.
     until the tombstone; there one day
     untouched by envy's bitter smarting,
     upon it, and with head down-bent
     upon the side of the distaff --
     villages flickered far and near,
     visit the family, what d'you say?
     walked homeward round the kitchen garden;
     was an enchanting country nook:
     was by forebodings much oppressed.
     was his; we'd both drunk passion's chalice:
     was just created for the part.
     was quite beyond his wit, we found.
     was still mysterious and enticing --
     was stripped away, and mists encroaching
     watch the games we maidens play.''
     we'll draw it deeper in our net;
     we'll keep love's price appreciating,

     were picking berries from the bough,
     were served in order of their rank.
     were you in love when you were young?''
     we were swept off, in reverie's haze,
     what came from this unlooked-for meeting;
     whatever you may need, just call...
     what have your wits to do with me?
     what traps he'd set him, with what malice
     when, utterly worn out by rhyming,
     when we see him from afar,
     where Tanya now confronts Eugene.
     which I myself won't praise or blame
     which held him silently subjected,
     which smilingly your friend, supported
     while a mazurka holds the crowd;
     while dear Tatyana's youth grows dimmer:
     while odes have high and noble aims...''
     while roar of violins contrives
     while serious topics were disputing,
     who late at night are whirled away
     who on a deuce, that famous cheat,
     whose heart experience has cooled
     whose kindly hand will ruffle down
     whose memory will preserve for me
     who sets me snoring then and there --
     wild as a forest deer, and fearful,
     will disappear as fast as smoke:
     will in my soul be hushed and dying.
     will loyally discharge its duties,
     wine of the Comet6 fills the cup;
     with Eugene proved a tempting prize.
     with The Well-Meaner10 on her knee?
     with a Venetian maiden who
     with a blunt cue for the duration,
     with amber pipes from Tsaregrad;12
     with a small tray and a teacup.
     with brilliant conquests by the shower,
     with bursts of passion from the heart,
     with careful schemes of decoration
     with charming forefinger she traced
     with combs, and steel utensils serving
     with comedies of swarm and din;
     with cranium aching fit to split;
     with deep emotion through and through,
     with each nuance of wintry glow:
     with grave goodbyes to the bereaved,
     with lively and pellucid look,
     with me to see an alien strand;
     with mournful sound the secret shade
     without a trace of spite or plot,
     without a word Tatyana leant
     with sheer enchantment fills her cup!
     with sighs unconsciously regretful.
     with such a blissful, brief infection --
     with tenderness he'd watched and noted
     with three roan horses in a line
     with trees decked in their silvery kit,
     with young Semy?nova,9 and there
     with your good offices, and so
     word on his lips, and thought: it's sheer
     words mispronounced, thoughts ill-expressed
     worthier of you in the perfection
     would bless the form his fortune took.
     would have been spared this laceration.
     would launch into self-sacrifice;
     wronged always in disgraceful fashion --
     years back, to call up many a fable;
     yes, these were our forefathers' ways,
     yet a capricious inclination,
     yet floods of talk around the town...
     yet he'd back you through thick and thin:
     yet how I wish that I might raise
     you called there twice, and since then took
     you drink the magic draught of yearning,
     you gave me such a shocking fright!
     you kept your friendship with our friend:
     you know I'm hard to comprehend...
     you learn life's sweetness, and with this
     you newborn work, and like a winner
     your dashing one, is she surviving?''
     you're all in fever... heavens above.''
     your early life, unlock your tongue:
     you're sure to find her portrait in it:
     your molten gold, your charmed infusion;
     your night of fretting's left no trace!
     your soul displays, in holy dreams,
     you see your fated tempter stand.
     youth is a fever; we must spare
     youth's choice, the flower of French cuisine:
     youth which has nothing to regret,
     you've made so many secret rhymes,
actions, suite d'un sentiment de sup?riorit? peut-?tre imaginaire.

     than this humiliating passion
     and than these letters, and these tears.
     At least you then showed for my years
     respect, and mercy for my dreaming.
     But now! what brings you to my feet?
     What trifling could be more complete?

     and all this flashy masquerading,
     the glare, the fumes in which I live,

     give for a bookshelf, a neglected

     mother implored me; my sad station

     for honour, a straightforward pride.

     She went -- and Eugene, all emotion,
     stood thunder-struck. In what wild round
     of tempests, in what raging ocean
     his heart was plunged! A sudden sound,
     the clink of rowels, met his hearing;
     Tatyana's husband, now appearing...
     But from the hero of my tale,
     just at this crisis of his gale,
     reader, we must be separating,
     for long... for evermore. We've chased
     him far enough through wild and waste.
     Hurrah! let's start congratulating
     ourselves on our landfall. It's true,
     our vessel's long been overdue.
     {231}
        XLIX
     Reader, I wish that, as we parted --
     whoever you may be, a friend,
     a foe -- our mood should be warm-hearted.
     Goodbye, for now we make an end.
     Whatever in this rough confection
     you sought -- tumultuous recollection,
     a rest from toil and all its aches,
     or just grammatical mistakes,
     a vivid brush, a witty rattle --
     God grant that from this little book
     for heart's delight, or fun, you took,
     for dreams, or journalistic battle,
     God grant you took at least a grain.
     On this we'll part; goodbye again!
        L
     And my companion, so mysterious,
     goodbye to you, my true ideal,
     my task, so vivid and so serious
     and yet so light. All that is real
     and enviable for a poet,
     in your pursuit I've come to know it:
     oblivion of life's stormy ways,
     sweet talk with friends. How many days
     since, through the mist that dreams arise on,
     young Tanya first appeared to me,
     Onegin too -- and there to see,
     a free romance's far horizon,
     still dim, through crystal's magic glass,
     before my gaze began to pass.
     {232}
        LI
     Of those who heard my opening pages
     in friendly gatherings where I read,
     as Sadi17 sang in earlier ages,
     ``some are far distant, some are dead''.
     They've missed Eugene's completed etching.
     But she who modelled for the sketching
     of Tanya's image... Ah, how great
     the toll of those borne off by fate!
     Blest he who's left the hurly-burly
     of life's repast betimes, nor sought
     to drain its beaker down, nor thought
     of finishing its book, but early
     has wished it an abrupt goodbye --
     and, with my Eugene, so have I.

     whoever you may be, a friend,
     a foe -- our mood should be warm-hearted.
     Goodbye, for now we make an end.
     Whatever in this rough confection
     you sought -- tumultuous recollection,
     a rest from toil and all its aches,
     or just grammatical mistakes,
     a vivid brush, a witty rattle --
     God grant that from this little book
     for heart's delight, or fun, you took,
     for dreams, or journalistic battle,
     God grant you took at least a grain.
     On this we'll part; goodbye again!

        L

     And my companion, so mysterious,
     goodbye to you, my true ideal,
     my task, so vivid and so serious
     and yet so light. All that is real
     and enviable for a poet,
     in your pursuit I've come to know it:
     oblivion of life's stormy ways,
     sweet talk with friends. How many days
     since, through the mist that dreams arise on,

     among the maidens and the wives,
     and Dunya works the samovar;
     and I be by the world forgot;
     and I'll be thirty in a trice?
     and I surrender to my fate.''
     and Lensky follows her... Eugene,
     and Lensky, left eye closing, aimed --
     and Paris too. But hear my pleading:
     and all into the salon squeeze,
     and all our modish education;
     and all the neighbours planned a match
     and all the works of Fontanelle16 --
     and almost swoons, and almost dies.
     and also prettier, I'll be bound,
     and although Troy's greybeards, collected
     and an insouciant lorgnette.
     and arm in arm they all go through;
     and as in some appalling dream
     and, as observer, to be present
     and at the very self-same time
     and beat a nacreous wing when caught
     and bliss for him is when he hotly
     and blood had bubbled as it flowed;
     and brandishes her tinsel splendour
     and charming reverie's vain deflection
     and cheers salute him. Tanya must
     and clasps her neck; and now she sees
     and counsellor (retired) Fly?nov,
     and, curious now about the lot,
     and daily scenes of modish life
     and doctors, he'd have died in bed.
     and eatables beyond all classing
     and evening now drew on in mist...
     and every night shares her repose.
     and every plea that lips can treat;
     and exclamations, and good cheer.

     and finds the world a darkling show?
     and flown like arrows from a bow.
     and for belle Nina, as it read,
     and for her cheeks to cease their blushing;
     and frames would shudder, windows tremble;
     and from her eyes the eager tears
     and from the salon the princess,
     and from within come noise and cheer;
     and gallops. Pistols made for pairing
     and gave our heroine enjoyment
     and growing thicker; then, heart-shaking,
     and he pursuing, till at length
     and hetman of the gambling-halls,
     and home he drives, deep-sunk in thought.
     and hope and passion; life had glowed
     and human words, and horse's stamp!
     and in a singsong voice confide
     and in flat calm I've found the stuff
     and in full brilliance shines the ball.
     and in his look there shows somehow
     and in my soul, o spring, how madly
     and in the bath-house had a table
     and in the country, blissful, horned,
     and just a double charge of shot
     and kept quite silent while she read.
     and kisses smack as young girls greet;
     and life celestial's phantom gleams,
     and like an arrow from a bow
     and little dancing whirls of snow
     and locked him in a dark recess.
     and looked at him without a word,
     and look, my cousin's come, Buy?nov,
     and look serenely on your beauty!...
     and magic nights. In headlong course
     and mileposts grip the idle sense
     and my whole life has been directed
     and nameless rivulet, that scene
     and not because she'd once preferred
     and now at last he saw the World.
     and now the crunchy snow is stripping
     and on her cheeks the fever stays,
     and, on the crosses, jackdaw hosts.
     and on the flames let fall unseen
     and on their marks has made them stand;
     and opened Schiller... but the embrace
     and pale, and fade without a word!
     and paler than the moon at dawn,
     and parted from her by their star.
     and part in kindness? Just the same,
     and parts the fringes of his curtain;
     and pay my debt in the same coin
     and plaits a piebald shoe of bast;
     and pledged to you, and firmly planned:
     and put our heart into a shiver
     and read my Apuleius keenly,
     and rest myself from earlier days.
     and rightly so, but now his pain
     and says: ``Farewell, you vales and fountains!
     and, scroll in hand, before her eyes
     and sees... whatever do you think?
     and set on hating the coquette,
     and sets her gently on the floor.
     and she, submissively, inertly --
     and should have played a different part:
     and shout, and make room for the pair.
     and shouts suggest a crowded wake;
     and silently he hung his head.
     and sleeping sounder than a rock.
     and slowly day begins to climb.
     and so he lacks the strength to mention
     and so in winter-fields will shiver
     and soon they bring her... a guitar
     and soon will day's bright tune be played;
     and so the harmless chat progresses
     and still exempted from removal
     and, still transparent to the view,
     and still within, behind the veil
     and stops his doleful heart from sleeping:
     and strip the forest round about.
     and swaggers in a red calpack;
     and swarming in his inmost soul.
     and taken by the French -- some prize! --
     and tea and supper; there's an inner
     and tea's brought in. Instead of chimes
     and that embittered mind which boils
     and the Skot?nins, grizzled sages,
     and the blancmanger, then a fleet
     and then concludes: she loves him yet!
     and then it's tea that comes to mention,
     and then old cousin Pelag?ya
     and the poet, without a sound,
     and there at large he goes patrolling
     and there a tombstone says its word
     and the young city-bred newcomer,
     and those we sing for will be paid
     and though my muse may be capricious,
     and thought, a sleepy numbness steals;
     and thoughts of her were what inspired him
     and to Tanya, when he was through,
     and took two Petriads in calf,
     and to that far and lonely nook
     and to the vision of those mortal
     and trails alone around the wood.''

     and wakened Lensky by exclaiming:
     and watched a different world unroll.
     and watch him stubbornly bring low
     and ``what's your name?'' she asks him, speaking
     and when, by misty moon, the east
     and where Terpsichore alone
     and where Thalia, gently napping,
     and where he'd silently agreed.
     and where is love's tempestuous yearning,
     and where's her sister now? and where,
     and while the star still flew, she'd hurry
     and whiskers -- all of this it keeps
     and whisper ``Dunya, pay attention!''
     and whist, that's now so keenly f?ted --

     a rooster head, and on the twitch
     around Priam the much-respected,
     around her neck, or when for her

     as from their luscious hive go tumbling
     a shadow, null and meaningless,
     as if a cold hand squeezed her heart,
     as if beneath her, dark and rumbling,
     as if she'd been profoundly sleeping,
     a simple monument is built.
     a single thing to her. His head

     as much of banquets and the cork
     a soul that perished long ago,
     as pair by pair the dancers fly.

     he drinks -- all shout and take a swill;
     he drives in brilliant sun; striated
     he drives there like a bird in flight,
     he drives up in and out of season
     he'd sack the Muses and get wedded;
     he'd see his soul cool in its grate;
     he eyes the door, looks slyly through.
     he fell in love with darkest wildwood,
     he found Tatyana so attractive,
     he found too much that he regretted:
     he goes ahead and parts the motley
     he had conveyed some moral teaching,
     he has to bring the battle-case.
     he hears a voice; ``well, what? he's killed!''
     he informed this envoy diplomatic
     he knew too well that sort of scene.
     he laughs -- they all begin to chuckle;
     held in constraint by pity's touch:
     he leaves one morning the hermetic
     he leaves the house, calls for his horse
     he looks, and sees the hour of day --
     he looks, in sweet irresolution,
     helping the poor, or while I mended
     he murmurs: ``Olga's mine for saving;
     her Russian was as thin as vapour,
     her darling foot of its wet shoe,
     her discomposure, her confusion,
     her drops of tears, and seated there,
     he read of course the sceptic Bayle15
     hereditary foes they seem,
     here's Petushk?v, the local fop;
     here's tea that Olga's been preparing;
     her eyes are lowered, but ablaze,
     her face would pale, she'd start to quiver.
     her feelings were far more inclined --
     her fingers shake, she doesn't dare
     her full account of voiceless pain?
     her golden earrings off and whipping;
     her handkerchief has fallen too;
     her hands affectionately pressed;
     her head in modesty cast down,
     her heartache, did it long compel her,
     her heart had spoken, free as air,
     her heart speaks to her even louder
     her husband's or the world's attention...
     her journey home is overdue.
     her kindness, move Tatyana; yet
     her nerves, she leant on it her weight,
     her out-of-fashion clothes!... oh, mercies!
     her out-of-fashion turns of phrase,
     her path a hare in headlong flight
     her sacred store of bliss and weeping
     herself not knowing how or why)
     her soul's attention; just behind her
     her steppeland charms into a rout.3
     her thoughts away, knew how to lavish
     her way; she passed, then as she walked
     her youth with all his repertoire
     he's at the club, a real stayer,
     he saw no point in staying on,
     he's called you out -- say, in your soul
     he scowls -- and the whole gang are still;
     he sends a letter, penned with passion.
     he sends, a second, then a third.
     he's first to toast her in the bowl,
     he's got consumption. In his anguish
     he's happy, yes, he's almost well...
     he's host, that's obvious. Thus enlightened
     he should have settled for disarming
     he's left sad footprints on the ground.
     he's lost his self-command, and crazed
     he's moved... you see him from the side.''
     he sounds, in lyric frenzy sunk,
     he's put belle Tatiana instead.
     he's racing millward like a bird.
     he steers her, nonchalantly gliding,
     he stoops and, tenderly confiding,
     he's up the steps, with heart a-quiver
     he takes her to a chair, beginning
     he trembles, knows not what to tell;
     he warns his man for duty, stressing
     he watched the guests and, as he dined,
     he whirls her through the wood... a hovel
     he would have found a normal fate.
     high time he should be on his way.
     his French valet, Guillot, is there
     his awkwardness, he's hardly said
     his bow was wholly unaffected.
     his converse gave Onegin pleasure;
     his dull, sick look, his dumb reproach --
     his foolish face; more pleasant yet
     his head upon her shoulder... blaze
     his humbly suppliant approach,
     his illness lends him courage and
     his itching verse, Monsieur Triquet
     his lyre, now stilled, in its high mission
     his mind's eye focused on the hinted
     his nag has smelt the snow, and planted
     his nature would be changed and steadied,
     his neighbour entered at a rush
     his news has set the party humming!
     his pistols, laid them in their case,
     his pup to grace the sledge, while he
     his serfs rejoicing at their lot.
     his spindly, shaggy nag. As fitting,
     his sweetheart faithful to her grief.
     his tea with rum quite left behind,
     his thoughts were on a distant goal:
     his thrusting horns, and as he passes
     his virulence that made you smile,
     his weary head, and softly drooping
     his wit, according to the rules
     his young heyday's supreme employment,
     hoar-frost and sun in freezing weather,
     hold half the world still unreleased,
     hope that he's had no time to fashion
     how I interpret this expression:
     how are your kith and kin today?
     how envious was I of the waves
     how fearful, too, is my obsession
     how long is it?'' ``And since I fed
     how many follies were engendered;
     how many lines of verse, and themes
     how pleasantly the stages pass.
     how proudly, how divinely gleaming,
     how sad the scar of passion's knife:
     how sensuously her eyes are dreaming!
     how soon the bounds of rank and station
     how they remind me of your stem,
     how to engage in talk that drew
     how well she'd studied her new role!
     humbly I heard your lesson out?
     hunts cheeky flies, with swatter sweeping,
     hymnal as, endlessly unfurled,
     hymns of the ages never sound.
     if her cross mood was at its worst --
     if, motionless, no life appearing,
     if not slow-witted, might have known.
     if you'd still been with me, dear friend,
     (if you'll turn back to chapter one)
     ignores approval's friendly clapping,
     impatient, hatred flaming high;
     impatiently on the mill-dam,
     importune with my lyre, whenever
     in Lyc?e gardens long ago,
in Russia among the common people.'' Pushkin's note.
     in Russian never found expression,
     in Russian winters thrilled at seeing
     in albums, blunted the censorious

     in a melodious, flute-like tone.
     in a peaked cap, all dust and fluff, --
     in a still stream that never dries.
     in bed, a young man, stiff and chilled;
     in boxes or the rows of stalls.
     in britzkas, kib?tkas and sleighs.
     in corners whispering girls concur;
     in country towns and suchlike places
     in darkest forest depths and drowned
     in deep anxiety of mind.
     in deepest thought at the chess-board
     in dream toward the woods and plains,
     in due succession; hers is lifted
     in empty deeds and futile toils.
     in everything she sees there's not
     in fact a thorough fop, no less.
     in far Moldavia, fit for pity,
     in fashion that's half-glad, half-anguished:
     in father's or old uncle's book,
     in flannel, and an old fur cap.
     in frosted bottle, for the poet

     in grief that nothing else could mend;

     is on his feet -- in utter stillness

     is softly, indolently sleeping,

     it brought back Tanya from her trance.
     it had its epigram-potential7...
     it held me captive; tit for tat,
     it hurts, he laughs, and all in vain
     it led him, in these early sessions,
     it may be late, but it's a start.
     it melts, away it rushes, racing
     it's also true, in battle's rapture,
     its barely noticeable stream.
     its due oblivion, in the hush
     ``it seems that he forgot us all.''
     its furrow through the powdery icing;
     its glaring feasts, and shrill events,
     its grip on him, forgot to count
     it's hidden deep in gloom and dust.
     its image, then to swoon before
     it's late, time's passing... not to mention,
     its newness with our faded days,
     it's new to us, beyond gainsaying;
     it's not in him to bring me bliss.''
     its pristine charm: heeltaps, and leaps,
     its sails go flap-flap as it prances;
     it stirs her drooping soul to bound
     it stood, defiant of destruction
     its views, its passions, or its cares!
     its work, its torture, its enjoyment,
     it was goodbye, Monsieur l'Abb?.
     it was quite torn in half and breaking.
     it was that he'd been truly stirred,
     jaws masticate as minutes pass:
     jealously, shyly, I've imported
     jointly would tread life's humble way!
     just as she'd always been, she tripped
     just look, and never mind the chatter...
     just there, is talking to the Spanish
     just what the nightmare signifies.
     just yesterday.'' ``And since your christening
     knowing the offender, he'd been frightened

     lest in forgetfulness complete
     lest signs of casual weakness drew

     let's go together, take a rest...
     let's go where, winding all the time
     levy their tribute on the plain;
     lickspittles who adore their crawling,

     like Delvig3 when he's dining drunk.
     like Regulus, that god of honour,
     like a majestic moon, she drives
     like fields in spring when storms arrive.
     like foliage in the rotting fall.
     like irksome phantoms, null as zero.
     like mindless youth, the waltz goes by
     (like passion's dream, that other revel)

     my little feet, where have you vanished,
     my noon is here, and that's the truth.
     my soul had heard your voice ring clear,
     my span, that fortune's jurisdiction
     my strange, incorrigible man.

     of Neva's proud imperial water,
     of Russian verse, its force in action, --

     of absence on my wandering ways!
     of any Br?guet: and in passing
     of a provincial ing?nue,
     of ardent speech, that aching flow
     of boiling youth did I desire
     of certain ladies' tiny feet.
     of chalk the window-panes have taken.
     of distant countries, of moonlight...
     of evening, and those tears, the balm
     of far-away Onegin's name.
     of fate, and life, each in its turn
     of five more steps they went, slow-gaited,
     of goblets, tall and slender pretties;

     of house-familiars stands dismayed...
     of its unvarnished monochrome.
     of jealousy has made her start,
     of language which, so long ago,
     of leaves that autumn killed for good,
     of lovelorn girls was nothing new?
     of love's anxiety. Blessed is he
     of love so timorous and gentle.
     of modish belles the modish foe,
     of moralistical persuasion,
     of oligarchical converse,
     of one sole thought holds him in keeping
     of other's thought -- a splendid goal;
     of perfect bliss in you. Enough!
     of philosophic brains, about
     of philosophic isolation,

     of ranks and ages so diverse.
     of rugs, and carpets' rich refinement.
     of ruts that grace our fatherland.
     of secret pain... but it's now rated
     of secrets, like a friend but dearer,

     of sighs, and compliments, and fire;
     of social buzz and modish riot,
     of solitude, and peace abiding!
     of spires and belfries, in a cup
     of spring he lives, he's energetic;
     of sudden brightness... it's too curious...
     of sumptuous flowers and luscious fruit.
     of sunlight makes it flash and crumble,
     of swaddling clothes -- already blighted!
     of swooning, Tanya nearly dies;
     of tears will cloud her tender gaze.
     of that old duellistic fox,
     of the cotillion's endless theme
     of the dull shores of my disfavour,
     of their society turned her savage,
     of the most harmless, hopeless trash.
     of the old Tatyana. Eugene tried
     of the two girls; their premonition

     of traveller's tedium at its peak:
     of unaffectedly fantastic
     of useful objects that the curious
     of waiting for the dawn to blush,
     of wandering tribesmen; while the ravage
     of whispering woods where my Eugene,
     of wild repentance and devotion

     old mother winter at her pranks.
     old prejudice; all men are zeros,

     on Eugene's lips. In his dejection,
     on Finland's coast a lonely rover --
     on a small bench by Tanya's bed,
     on billiard-table rests a cue,
     once more, at that beloved sight,
     once more he can't await the night;
     once more renounces world and din.
     once, with its foaming and its playing,
     on cups of coffee, and then later
     one day came down that lonely turning,
     one finds in war amusing sport,
     one leads the multitude in thought,
     one listened to a chief of mission
     one raves in verse like me, and one
     one sees a duck and aims his gun,

     set off the ladies like a frame.
     sets a sonorous cadence rolling --
     set the guests smiling at his arch,
     set to well-known children's glee:
     shadows that flit behind the glazing
     shall I see you?'' As Tanya speaks
     shall my sad gaze no more alight
     shall not attack my lily's root;
     sharing her in promiscuous fashion,
     she appears before him, grim and frozen.
     she brought her talents, never ceased,
     she burst into a coughing-bout.
     she can't; Evgeny's pushed the portal,
     she can't; and in her panic hurry
     she can't escape at any pace --
     she can't make out a single fraction
     she'd cheer my wordless way, and do
     she did what nurse advised she do
     she doesn't see, or doesn't mind;
     she drinks it like a priceless potion;
     she finds, in order alphabetic:
     she finds in river and in hill.
     she finds it stifling here... she strains
     she flails around, she tries to shout --
     she flies as fast as she can go;
     she flies no more, she's lost her strength.
     she found, in labours and in leisure,
     she guards, in silence and for good,
     she holds a letter up, and leaning
     she looks, the room is getting light --
     she lost the language of the gods
     she loved the steppe-land and its singing,
     she lowers darkened eyes, unwitting,
     she never even bit her lip.
     she never read a Russian paper,
     she once had pined in girlish grief,
     she peers discreetly through a chink
     she roams the empty garden-plot...
     she sat there; through her teeth a word
     she saw no friendly figure starting
     she sees it all. The simple maiden,
     she sighed, and in a trance coopted
     she sits down calmly on one side,
     she's nearly swooned, she's suffocating;
     she speeds her footsteps to a race,
     she's their great friend, asked in, caressed,
     she stopped at the loud torrent's bound,
     she's turned up in my garden, bringing
     she treads our earth, and how her breast
     she visited the humble tents
     she walked across a snowy plain

     so Lensky answered the old dear:
     so all went smoothly after that.
     so brilliantly he'd hoax the fools,
     so circumspect, and so punctilious,
     so, cursing women's devious course,
     so effortlessly can disarm.
     so gloriously he'd fool the clever,
     so heartless and so detrimental,
     so, if we want to change, we can!
     so it was not in any measure,
     solemn, too long compelled to throttle
     solitude, stillness and the night,

     so, seeing there no rhyme or reason,

     so unforgiving a report?
     so virtuous that, no sooner seen,
     spared her the expense she dreaded most --

     spends light and darkness in the dreary

     struck for Evgeny, with its play

     stumblingly call to mind he did
     such frank tendresse; away they stole
     such good and sensible advice;
     such is the usual country cooking;

     that, artless, and without concealing,
     that corps of social legislation --
     that could sustain it? Only grimness;
     that fell, and then began to shiver,
     that fiery souls' headstrong enthusing

     that he's not honest past all question.''
     that huge ballrooms vibrated under,
     that in the usual Christmas scrimmage
     that lady the hostess was greeting,
     that lady whose engaging charm
     that languid beauty, listens nicely --
     that lives, and glitters, and endears,
     that marble Nina's proved unable
     that, meanwhile, pinched and glum of feature,
     that mediocre dress alone
     that moment, of a luscious pie
     that night, in secret, set for two;
     that not a syllable be uttered
     that nubile maid of riper age,
     that one be shot just anyhow --
     that on the world's staircase there waited
     that poisonous worm, despised, degrading,
     that rogue, backbiter, pantaloon,
     that she's ``ideal'', begins preparing
     that she's so trustful, and imbued
     that somehow that same day we'll meet...
     that soul without a moral tie,
     that spring with me has had its fill
     that's the morass, I beg you note,
     that stretched from Romulus in his prime
     that strikes him with such force and meaning?
     that table where the lamp has languished,
     < that there existed, for the indulgence
     that this of all things for a swain
     that, though polite, was clear as ice.
     that we enjoy equating chatter
     that wicked, loose-tongue chatterbox...
     that wit embarrasses the dull;
     that with him to the trysting-place
     that your proud glance is sure to take!
     that youthful heart. ``But now at least
     the Major's here: he's all the rage

     the Russian for le comme il faut.
     the abstracted poet would bring forth
     the album of a country miss
     the altar flame's extinguished now.
     the ancients have gone stiff and cold,
     the answer's past all human viewing,
     the art he'd studied best of all,
     the ballroom drove me off my head:
     the bank, the immobile stream are levelled
     the barbs that envy's always spreading,
     the bear explains: ``my cousin's here --
     the bear has raised her in his paws;
     the bear let out a roar, and held
     the bear -- what next? -- behind her stalked.
     the beauties in their flimsy dresses,
     the best revenge one could desire.
     the big room, further, not a cat.
     the blaze of candles, and the trembly
     the bleeding tongues, the tufted tails,
     the bliss that fills me when your throbbing,
     the blood came smoking from the wound.
     the bloom has withered on the bough;
     the boring wives, the ill-bred men,
     the branches all are weighted down
     the branches of the oak with flock;
     the cabinet behind the door
     the carriage of the newly-wed.
     the child prepares for protocol --
     the children spoilt, the mad, the rogues
     the circumstances of his capture
     the climacteric of our life,
     the coach has reached its destination;
     the cold perfection of the sky,
     the cooks prepare the midday meal;
     the coolness of the sombre glade,
     the country cottages and hovels,
     the crash of plates and knives is blended
     the days that doom has measured out.
     the deeper in the wood, the more
     the doorway opened wide to meet her,
     the downy woods are greener-tinted;
     the draught whose blessings are agreed,
     the driver sits and cuts a dash
     the eager players are enrolled --
     the earlier griefs are what I miss.
     the early pealing of the bells
     the earth for him grew dumb and closed?...
     the elegy, grown paralytic,
     the enjoyment of a friendly drink,
     the expanse of fields, so wide, so lonely,
     the eyes of all, the hooves, the snozzles,
     the faces met with everywhere;
     the fear and rage with which I foam!
     the festal name day has begun.
     the first will never find fruition,
     the flaming roses of a cheek,
     the fleeting tenderness that stole
     the flickering tones of dress and speech,
     the floor serves Triquet for his nap,
     the foes, cold-blooded and unspeaking,
     the fools who sparkle far and wide,6
     the foreign words a maiden's passion
     the friends' salute she never hears
     the frozen corpse, drives off, and homing
     the full fruit of her heart's desire;
     the funeral monument explains:
     the giddiest hope, carefree and gay,
     the girl he'd scorned in what he deemed
     the girl remains there in the gloom
     the girl's attentive eyes are bent.
     the girl's pale charms, her loosened hair,
     the girls sing out the ancient rhyme:
     the grand barouche is on its way.
     the grand monde finds it out of place.
     the grey-haired nurse with kerchiefed head;
     the guardian angel of tradition,
     the guests squeeze closer to the centres;
     the hall's without a living creature,
     the hapless Phrygians all the same,
     the happenings of the previous night;
     the hare who from afar has seen
     the hat, the scowling brow, the chest
     the headpiece-text is thus indited --
     the heart and all its fragile dreams.
     the heart inside him seemed to shrink;
     the heavenly lights in glorious quire
     the highest circles are a bore.
     the horns, and the moustachio'd nozzles --
     the horrid nightmare must portend
     the horror of disgrace and crime,
     the hostess cries and, moving fast,
     the hour was late. And now from aching
     the household boys in noisy rout;
     the hunter in the wood will swear
     the impatient conqueror was humbled!
     the imperturbable princess.
     the infant year with cheerful greeting:
     the inmost thoughts that girls can hide.
     their breed would (some years after this)
     their cloaks; Zaretsky's measured off
     their hands are dipped in scarlet gore,
     their hand to grapple slander's cup,
     their hopes, their pranks, their dreams at night --
     their journey took them a full week.
     the iron figure3 on the table,
     their table, and their hours of leisure?
     their unattractive t?te-?-t?te;
     the jagged flint's pulled back anew.
     the joys of youth, that festal cup,
     the keys that opened up the hall.
     the kiss where youth and freshness gleam;
     the leather rein, to learn the tale,
     the legatee of his relations --
     the letter from Tatyana's hand:
     the level tenor of his going,
     the lies that in the press run rife,
     the linen stretched on the tambour.
     the logs; the wild ones have the floor;
     the lucky bard, and as he dozed
     the lust for blood drew them apart?
     the maidens all are slumbering deep.
     ``the mail explains the time he's taking.''
     the man of honour and of sense.
     the man of reverie and reflection,
     the man she feared and idolized --
     the man who laid her brother low.
     the meaning of an epigraph,
     the men confront them, face to face:
     the merchant's up, the cabman's walking
     the millions of two-legged creation
     the moderns rage against the old.
     the modesty of her condition,
     the modish Record Office clerks
     the moon; but in the darkened glass
     the moon in its azure of air.
     the morning after, a surprise
     the morning light no longer lingers,
     the murmuring Nereids recite,
     the murmur where the streamlet played...
     then Lensky moved his pawn, and took,
     then afterwards, alone, at ease,
     the needle, never had she lingered
     the neighbour... you must tell the brat
     then from his cabinet he'll pass
     then he began to talk once more
     then he'd implore a declaration,
     then, help me God, she caterwauls:
     then he presents her with the scroll.
     the nightingale's begun to sing.
     the nightly luminaries climb.
     then in the study's quiet setting,
     then later slyly he'd revile them
     then night comes on; the moon's patrolling
     then, on the last page, the suggestion:
     then quickly something changed all this:
     then quietly at last says she:
     then, stepping nearer, Eugene said:
     then sudden fear attacked Tatyana...
     then to the altar, to be crowned.
     the occupations of the morning.
     the odious bear still grunts and lumbers.
     the old dame wept her daughter's parting,
     the one who killed the youthful poet?''
     the only face to shake and pass
     the pangs with which his heart was troubled,
     the party waits. Seized with an illness
     the pillars of the turnpike-gate;
     the poet struck down by his friend!
     the potholes make the coach unsteady.
     the prejudices of the ages,
     the prince bring up his own relation
     the prince looks at him, and replies:
     the quintessential reaction
     the regimental band is coming,
the relative merits of the classic ode and the romantic elegy.
     there'll be a fight. For that I give
     there never fails a kindly greeting,
     there's a small window shining in it,
     there's crashing, rumbling, pounding, trotting,
     there's not a word she's understood;
     there's nothing can employ her anguish,
     there's yap of pugs, and laughs, and bustle;
     there was a softness in his glance:
     there was no trace to be detected
     the ring of marriageable girls --
     the rogue has got a finger frozen:
     the sad beginnings of his life
     the safest place for declarations,
     the same as any other day.
     the secret of her husband's measure,
     the secrets of the grave, the pages
     the shades of night within their keeping
     the shady wood, the talking stream;
     the shepherd, as he used to do,
     the shepherd sings of Volga's fishing
     the simple legend -- then a haze
     the sky is brilliant in its blue
     the snow from all surrounding hills;
     the solitude of woods and tillage,
     the source's chattering voice is heard;
     the spring invites you to the land
     the spring of honour, and the pin
     the stars, the moon -- celestial light
     the strangeness of her habitation,
     the sumptuous palais shines out;
     the swarm, the glittering mob that presses,
     the talk of guests when they appear;
     the tears in stream pour down her cheeks.
     the third day, wood and hill and grazing
     the thirst for work, the lust for learning,
     the threshold's thronged, wet-nurses call,
     the time to go has long since passed
     the tolerant Evgeny heard --
     the towers of whitestone Moscow beaming
     the trail the youthful poet followed
     the tusks, the corpse's finger-nails,
     the two foes stand with eyes downcast.
     the units are ourselves alone.
     the unmetric verses of tradition
     the untiring city, where you've given
     the vales dry out, grow brightly printed;
     the valley's dark. The forest lands
     the vital force gives them the shoot
     the war, the snowfall, and his wife.
     the whole thieves' kitchen flies asunder,
     the wild rose blooms, and in the covert
     the wine-addict adores the cup:
     the winter's ways are smooth as glass.
     the world and all its works, she wept
     they all have richly earned a pension;''
     they all have swarmed into the hall,
     they all still keep their old impress:
     they'd just enrage it with their dart.
     the year, his age, then: ``may your rest,
     they find her somewhat unexpected,
     they fluff her curls out in the fashion,
     they heap up silver with a spade;
     they kill the zest of rhymed composing,
     they managed to disperse the pack.
     they nudged Tatyana, and each muttered
     the young hostess, towards whom each
     the youthful votary of rhyme
     the youth of those past days in line
     they praise the Father of the world.
     they're all chained up in different fetters,
     they're on the dance-floor, waltzing, spinning.
     they're plunging, whirling, all but squatting.
     they rise and ripen and fall dead:
     they shared their days in deed and heart,
     they shove each plate, and every chair,
     they sit, they cross themselves for grace.
     they talk of her, of how and whether:
     they've moved around and been reseated;
     thickly the exclamations fly.
     thinking: he loved me, and in strife
     thirty-two steps with great precision,
     this Grandison of hers was splendid,
     this angel, this proud devil, tell,
     ``this is the one!'' Ah, ever stronger,
     this was the science of that passion
     those walks amid the gloom and calm
     those words where love, without condition,
     though I'll come back to him, yet clearly
     though Menelaus, in Helen's name,
     though he's unknown, there's no suggestion
     though some support it with good grace).
     thought, day and night, and thought again
     though there he's no more to be found,
     though we... don't shine in any way,
     though what's romantic here I simply
          thou, my Svetlana!
     threats, vows, and simulated fears,
     three carts -- traditional procession --
     threw Eugene at her feet -- she stirred,
     thrives to this moment, in a station
     through baseness of the soul that he,
     through gloom and mist; and there came streaming
     through him is sweetness' self. In grumbling
     throughout the boredom of the hours --
     throw meadows into muddy rout,
     thumps as the balls are pressed inside
     till Moscow, meekly on its knees,
     till he at last was summoned down
     till now our language -- proud, God knows --
     time was, in evening hours of leisure,
     time was when morning's breeze was swaying
     to Eugene; nineteen to the dozen,
     to Eugene's letter, word for word.
     to Evgeny. Oh, God, she'd never...
     to Moscow settled in a trice.
     to Olga's face, he whispered low
     to aim, at steady, even pace
     to ask of you that you transcend
     to a soir?e. ``My God! to her!...
     to battle further with my passion;
     to bellow out: ``she's mine, she's mine.''
to be mentioned in so offhand a way''.
     to boom, to flash across the sky,
     to bring across Lepage's4 mortal
     to burn -- and then by force of reason
     to captivate, and then to fly.
     to clasp your knees, and at your feet
     to come back to the hall alone
     to comfort her in all her woes,
     to cool my glances and my tongue,
     to crack between them; for a while
     to demonstrate some signs of reason:
     to do them all is easy game.
     to drain, on credit, bottles three.
     to draw a breath, around her staring
     to dreaming given up unduly,
     to drop all that old-fashioned mumming;
     to each and every raving feast
     to encase herself inside a layer
     to ensure that till next time our image
     to expose to Moscow fops and Circes
     to face him now I feel too frail...
     to fashion's absolute dictate,
     to feasts and fun this winter past;
     to fresh grandparents every day.
     to gentlemen on every side
     to give you honest explanation.
     to happen long ago, dear readers,
     to hear him howl: ``that's me!'' You'll get
     to heart. And in his misted gaze
     to help her from the other side;
     to her flower-garden, to her novels, --
     to her glass porch; pursues her round
     to his Tatyana, yes, he's racing,
     to his disputing and his cursing;
     to his mysterious tree the snake
     to hit the target: thigh or brain.
     to hope that even once a week
     to infuriate a clumsy foe;
     to institute a new regime.
     to it the people's blessing never
     to kiss Armida's lips, or seek
     to know you, swooned, and in a second
     to lie down at her feet like slaves!
     to lift her skirt up; still she's flying,
     to lift his pistol up. A span
     to liven with a silk atour
     to meet a black monk, or if crossing
     to meet his thirsty lips... What daze,
     to meet the unhappy poet, skipped
     to me her best in-quarto tome,
     to mourn for Russia's gloomy savour,
     to my young days, it's time I turned
     too faint to stir a further pace:
     too long, against my inclination,
     too long he's hoaxed us high and low...''
     too pale, too thin, but on the whole
     to pass for an affected freak,
     to pass the evening. No? then tot
     to pass the time was Eugene's theme:
     to pine away from passion's thirst,
     to pranks and jokes of earlier date.
     to put on chains for him, and steady
     to puzzle out with some precision
     to raise the safety catch and strain
     to reasoned talk, no dull hearsay,
     torment of pride? And why's he come?
     to roar of banquets, din of brawling,
     to save the honour of our land
     to scorn the men with whom he deals;
     to see life as a ritual play,
     to see my kin, and in the end
     to see the grave, and shed a tear.
     to see you, faithfully to follow,
     to sing of others must imply
     to smother her dear feet with kissing.
     to sob out prayer, complaint, confession,
     to speak; believe me: of my shame
     to spoil loose paper by the ream;
     to steal away her neighbour's light
     to stem the bloodstream's wild outburst;
     to talk as if with heart unwrung,
     to talk of this and that, but then
     to talk to her, but language died.

     to the complacent and the null;
     to the empty homestead made her way,

     to the princess, in his weak hand,
     touches her hand, or throws a fur
     touches obliquely, but with speed,
     to undertake their resurrection,
     towards his stall, the pedlar's hawking;
     towards the Larins' and arriving
     towards the simple urn beneath;
     toward the neighbouring valley's river.
     to wave farewell the household waits

     to whisper it her inmost prayer.

     untouched by trace of inhibition,

     was it not you, dear apparition,

     what held me was my predilection,
     what holds her in profound reflection,
     what is he? Just an apparition,
     what it's transported to our shore
     what kind of thought, what observation,
     what moves along the hidden ways
     what occupied his chafing powers
     what odes Vladimir might have written --
     what play will he present this week?
     what's more, I loved you; but my hunger,
     what store of riches it imparts!
     what was it in your heart it found
     what wings our first successes gave!
     when Br?guet's chime is heard proclaiming
     when, from behind the doorway, hidden
     when galloping at headlong pace
     when he arrived; not in the slightest:
     when hourly we ourselves betrayed it,
     when, in pale sky, the stars' procession
     when in the park, in the all?e
     when little notes come on a tray.
     when night patrol's a perilous calling;
     when, on the plain, green herbs are massed,
     when our Zaretsky met his eyes.
     when our sublimest aspiration,
     when shall I start on my escape?
     when suddenly I saw this treasure

     where admonitions are pronounced,
     where are distress, commiseration?
     where are the reveries this time,
     where a sharp nail has made a dent.
          where can we find your equal?
     where civil treacheries are rife,
     where did that glum eccentric go,
     where dwelt this child of inspiration,
     where every day a bloodstained shade
     where fate had fixed our confrontation,
     where flows a little glittering brook,
     where folded arms are tightly pressed.
     where her security's complete.
     where he was master of his college,
     where, in a cab, and furious hurry,
     where in the heart of silence rang
     ``where master used to sit alone.
     where nowadays I'm soundly trounced,
     where scribbling friends have interjected
     where shall he go, my rogue, my hearty?
     where (standard rhyme) are youth and fleetness?
     where's the high aim, the ardent sense
     where the prize-boy of fashion's college
     where two old pinetrees stand united:
     where you were born as well, I think,
     whether from heaven or from hell,
     whether it goes careering past,
     which Ovid sang, for which the bard,
     which has recalled, without precision,
     which, listening with some condescension,
     which with a blush he leaves unread.
     while Petersburg's already rousing,
     while floors would split from crash of heel,
     while in the hut a girl is singing;
     while, marmot-like, he hibernated --
     while men, all sombre, all the same,
     while she's from top to toe surveyed;
     whispered by heart a note addressed
     whisper of breeze announces morning,
     whisper repeated to the crone.
     whispers some ballad of the hour,
     whither does all my yearning tend?
     who all his life would garner praise
     who can combine it with the free
     who'd sit, and at the end of play
     who early died as die the brave'' --
     who else? -- the hero of our novel!
     who, in good time, would calmly get
     who in the country spends her summer,
     who in the dark came flashing through
     who'll clap an entrechat, or scoff
     ``who loves you more than I, let's see
     whom shall we never find a bore?
     whom thirty centuries have adored!
     who never learnt how dreamers babble;
     who never scorned the social rabble;
     whose heart on dreams was wont to thrive,
     whose serfs are miserably thin;
     who swaggers in with the reply.
     who walks with sorrow, and with danger,
     who was it that you dreamt about?''
     ``why, Olga's younger, and she's bedded.
     why, at the thought, my husband's mother
     why fight what's known to be decisive?

     will blossom into splendid highways:
     will find the ice elude his grip
     will give you a complete reply.
     will halt her horse and, gripping tightly
     will in a flash decide his lot.
     will reach, and past the tomb's compound
     will the benighted reason smile,

     wishes his madness to the devil,
     with Eugene frozen where he stood.
     with Guillot; while pourparlers last
     with Olga, all have pierced her soul;
     with Tolstoy's2 brush, or decorated
     with a consumption, they've relied.
     with a first click, the catch is tried.
     with all our hearts, and who require
     with an avowal just as artless;
     with an obeisance I'll hand over...
     with any torture so exquisite
     with a quick look perusing lightly
     with balm of prayer my torn and rended
     with bended knees a windmill dances,
     with broods of children of all ages,
     with care Zaretsky stows away
     with custom, love would fade away;
     with deeds; that dunces now and then
     with deep emotion looks about
     with demoiselles of riper age;
     with draughts from love's enticing flask,
     with every different kind of rabble...''
     with every sort of home possession:
     with eyes aflame Onegin rises
     with eyes of love, with greed to swallow
     with fire from every cross of gold.
     with fond caress? whose adoration
     with foppery and too much starch,
     with fright, she hears the approaching bear;
     with gown and slippers; tearing hurry,
     with heart that's grown unused to praise,
     with her own forests and her meads...
     with his forefathers would seem better;
     within her bosom to abate,
     with irresistible refulgence,
     with jealousy beyond all measure
     with lampions studded all about
     with lies and jokes that packed a punch:
     with lines to mark where they were sleeping...
     with love and comfort in your meaning,
     with neighbour Lensky, the deceased.
     with old Anisia. The next day
     with our Mamas, and a sensation
     with our poor girl was kind and good;
     without a goal on which to fix,
     without an elegiac frill,
     without preliminary feeler
     without surprise or rage... his laden,
     with parks and mansions, open up.
     with passion and with shrewd obliqueness
     with perturbation and with worry;
     with pleasure on his vengeful act.
     with pots and basins out of mind,
     with puzzled and confused regard...
     with recent fortune, vainly waited
     with shelves of books deployed for action,
     with spinning noise and senseless flashing
     with storm and tumult in his head,
     with tears, in quarters of the maids:
     with the grand general in her wake --
     with the pink glow the snows assume
     with the resounding chime of glass.
     with the unmistakeable sideview
     with this the hero of my tale:
     with thoughts of him in ceaseless round.
     with tufts of snow; and through the lifted
     with visions of enchanted night,
with which XXXII ends, is Pushkin's own contribution, a sample as it were of
     with whom your thoughts are so obsessed --
     with work at home; but when he'd gone,
     with years no more to meet our gaze?
     won't even cross their minds by stealth...
     works where contemporary man
     would Hymen bring us -- blooms that might
     would be allied to him by fate;
     would fill Tatyana from afar
     would have been all that we required!
     would have divined the tender, shrinking
     would leave her dithering and tossing.
     would not have recognized again
     would on those evenings guess the fate
     would say goodbye and drive away,
     would settle, on the morrow morning,
     would talk, keep silent, laugh, then frown --
     wound that had seared my Tanya's heart!
     yes, even there its triumph grows.
     yes, focus on them your lorgnette,
     yes, in that spring-time, in low-lying
     yet, as each rule has its exception,
     yet dared not trust what I could see.
     yet he fell out of love at last
     yet people's malice and suspicion
     yet, truthfully and not in chaff,
     you acted well, that dread occasion,
     you age, and life's just grief and sadness...''
     you'd made appearance in my dreaming;
     you'd not so much as know the name,
     you find the country godforsaken;
     you help him to an honoured fate
     you in my arms on gingerbread?''
     you left no steps that could be tracked:
     you'll never leave me to my fate.
     you'll read: here's Pradt,7 here's Walter Scott!
     you'll recognize him soon enough, --
     you loved the opulent contact
     you made me drunk as one could ask!
     young poet, be for ever blest!''
     young traitresses by the platoon,
     you object of my guileless ditties!
     your Zeus, your Cypris, your whole band
     your advent swamps me in its flood!
     your battles, lawless and atrocious,
     your chorus, is it dead for ever?
     you're really going? Well, I'm sad.
     your feet, to pale and waste... what rapture!
     your grief would fail to touch my heart,
     your heart some self-restraint; for each
     your heels will squash the ladies' toes! >
     your heroes, raging and ferocious,
     your icy look, your stern dissuasion,
     your loved one, honourable reader!
     your matchlessness, to seek to capture
     your presence aches, and in my blood!
     your pride, some answer, or in truth
     yourself too long from social life.''
     your tears would flow -- but your emotion,
     your words, and in my soul to explore
     you see the two in uniform...
     youthful, who ripened in his time,
     you took an honourable part --
     you've paid insanity its due.
     you were the first ones he forswore;
     you won't find that quite so much catch...
