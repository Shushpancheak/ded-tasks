     it was goodbye, Monsieur l'Abb?.
     Is spleen his trouble, or the dumb
     Iv?n Petr?vich still is dumb,
     He was without that dithyrambic
     Remember the retort satiric!
     How oft she'd lead me, by the Tauric
     Is Others' View,5 that clever lyric,
     Eugene's response was automatic;
     Through the tight ranks -- aristocratic,
     Searching the table exegetic
     But soft! You hear? A scowling critic,
     themes popular or idealistic,
     from threads both sad and humoristic,
     boo Phaedra out as paralytic,
     Now, Lensky, would it be so bad
     The horses, as they sense the dead,
     The happiness of youth is dead,
     rapture was just two weeks ahead;
     Lel6 floats about above her head;
     with storm and tumult in his head,
     the ballroom drove me off my head:
     can disavow that. I have read
(Nabokov). While still at the Lyceum in Tsarskoe Selo, in 1815, Pushkin read
     before the fire a table's spread;
     but Olga would have never read!
     But that's enough. At once, in stead,
     anticipates a swim, in stead
     Tanya's undressed, and lies in bed.
     At last he wakes, and stirs in bed,
     Tatyana simply lay in bed,
     billiards are dropped, cue put to bed:
     ``OE'' devotedly inlaced.
     At first Onegin's tongue produced
     a stanza villainously padded.
     always before the volume ended
     They buzz -- but then all talk's suspended --
     Should your perfections be expended
     Always our fervid hero tended
     ``You know, it's true, how I attended,
     In the two sisters' rooms extended,
     High ceilings everywhere abounded;
     Poor Lensky! where the tomb is bounded
     Here stands, with shady park surrounded,
     6 These lines and the first twelve lines of stanza XLVII were discarded
     Her father, kindly, well-regarded,
     but in an earlier age retarded,
     I'm sick, my dear, I'm sick indeed.
     Eugene, with solemn face, paid heed,
     but you're not paying any heed.''
     Oh, when, and to what desert banished,
     My goddesses! Where are you banished?
     By chance those verses haven't vanished;
     Lensky, that tragic victim, died...
     If suddenly aloft she spied
     she lacked her sister's beauty, lacked
     Eugene, at Olga's side, was racked
     Meanwhile with pain her soul was girdled,
     A sudden clatter!... blood was curdled...
     The lady of the house has fled.
     the samovar of evening boiled,
     beneath it, vapour wreathed and coiled.
     For what charade is he apparelled?
     Evgeny looks at Lensky, chilled
     ``Well, what?'' the neighbour says, ``he's killed.''
     whose heart experience has cooled
     His hair was fashionably curled,
     he found all kinds of brickbat hurled.
     could it be she... or had he dreamed?
     The jealous poet's gloom is lightened!
     Tanya's no longer quite so frightened
     to nobody except a wizened
     below the others who have signed
     For several days she peaked and pined
     is in your poetry enshrined?''
     and pledged to you, and firmly planned:
     I had most surely never reckoned
     Tatyana went with them, and sped
     and where most surely notes are sped.
     on Olga; from heart's ache still spared,
     Or, as by Lethe's bank he slumbered,
     how many follies were engendered;
     friends, recollect how I surrendered
     Her tender touch had never fingered
     the needle, never had she lingered
     1 Pushkin first wrote ``imperial portraits''; but this he later altered
     if you come with me, they'll be flattered;
     Onegin, my good friend, was littered
     The aunts exchanged a look, they fluttered,
     I don't mean that she never shivered,
     both hearts to blaze had now expired;
     Beyond the stream there smoked and stirred
     no sound by which her soul is stirred.
     on Eugene, he was deeply stirred:
     deep in Moldavia the abhorred,
     Like convicts in a dream released
     hold half the world still unreleased,
     Still on the board, the beakers hissed,
     He thought that Olga'd be confused,
     a haze in me, but I grew used
     Napoleon here, intoxicated
     He's always with her: either seated
     The clock of doom had struck as fated;
     she fell in love -- the hour was fated...
     they buried Uncle, congregated
     its nullity I've always hated,
     He was no fool; appreciated
     That year the season was belated
     Lensky ingenuously related
     Lensky rejoiced. His designated
     to eat and drink, then separated
     So glut yourselves until you're sated
     Seeing Vladimir had defected,
     The tomcat, mannered and affected,
     quite self-absorbed and unaffected
     In French Onegin had perfected
     He sang of love, to love subjected,
     But who stands there, in this selected
     Whenever nyanya had collected
     before Onegin there collected
     Once home, he brought out and inspected
     However closely he inspected,
     Often of course you'll have inspected
     His father died; and (as expected)
     singing in chorus as directed
     But my Eugene that night directed
     I know, Godsent one, I'm protected
     By now whist's heroes have completed
     No path to see: the snow has drifted
     He was too young to have been blighted
     And suddenly her radiance lighted
     Suddenly, from a crest, she sighted
     expecting winter, nature waited --
     Winter!... The countryman, enchanted,
     his nag has smelt the snow, and planted
     Sometimes a landscape's represented,
     a tomb, a Cyprian shrine's invented,
     Lensky of course was quite untainted
     Between the lines of text as printed,
     Since earliest boyhood he had doted
     A thought was born, and quickly noted...
     From that rough spell at last exempted,
     she sighed, and in a trance coopted
     Outside the gate Tatyana parted
     treaties of nations long departed,
     but soon the ways we trod were parted
     Reader, I wish that, as we parted --
     Reader, I wish that, as we parted --
     So there she stood, forlorn, deserted!
     Now for the first time she's escorted
     Was she the Tanya he'd exhorted
     which smilingly your friend, supported
     a hundred times afresh distorted;
     And long, as if through mists that spurted,
     Eugene turned countryman. He tasted
     by heaven with such an unsubdued
     for maybe fortune will have saved
     as if some goal had been achieved.
     Russian pancakes were always served;
     conclude that it's high time she wed!...
     Lensky has watched: his rage has blazed,
     a masculine disguise to aid
     So my Zaretsky, as I said,
     Her eyes were opened, and she said
     then, stepping nearer, Eugene said:
     stumblingly call to mind he did
     two verses of the Aeneid.
     Still tumbling, devil, snake and Cupid
     Still in the porch, exhausted-stupid,
     He was sweet-natured, and yet wild.
     times were when I was sharp and bold:
     Boston and ombre for the old,
     ``My sweet, my dearest heart, I'm old,
     Is he a Melmoth, a Childe Harold,
     We each have enemies in this world,
     ditties of our secret world,
     spying my features, as he could,
     of calculated slander should,
     already stirred him as they should.
     4  This Russianized version of  the Greek Agatho  is  ``elephantine and
     until the grave by your strong hand:
     the letter from Tatyana's hand:
     for quite a while by fortune's hand.
     I feel a small foot in my hand;
     sometimes, in reverie's sacred land,
     to save the honour of our land
     His father failed to understand
     Tanya begins to understand
     Olga is there, he sees her stand
     to ask of you that you transcend
     a true companion to the end,
     He drained his glass down to the end
     and give her comfort to the end:
     ``All right, I'll come then...'' ``What a friend!''
     But don't be cross, my darling friend,
     Bordeaux, you're like a faithful friend,
     if you'd still been with me, dear friend,
     ``Boredom, that's what so bad, my friend.''
     I don't know why, but for my friend
     He's here -- Monsieur Guillot, my friend.
     Martin Zad?ka fails to mend;
     Goodbye, for now we make an end.
     Goodbye, for now we make an end.
     On whom alone can we depend?
     Onegin wastes, you'd almost find
     he leaves a tender verse behind,
     unfathomable to the mind;
     Evgeny echoed him: ``My second?
     ``Get up: it's gone six! I'll be bound,
     pursue his love -- and at one bound
     it stirs her drooping soul to bound
     a corpse on boards was all he found,

     perfervid language of the bard,
     out of the hand of that same bard:
     of Gulnare, he would play a card
     How could she? why, he'd never heard...
     and always the inspired regard --
     Tatyana lowered her regard
     Olga's no life in her regard:
     condemned to a lifetime of hard,
     and dead ideas from that old hoard,
     Eugene attends the boulevard,
     She entered the deserted yard.
     Now nearer... hooves... and in the yard

     I really dote upon the word:
     Arrived apace, he gives the word
     No, she's already pledged her word
     of trumpet, dagger, mask and sword,

     To private tastes we each subscribe:
     the usurers' voracious tribe.

     encore Mo?na,7 -- and rejoice
     At least I'll give him some advice:

     Spoilt by the habit of indulgence,
     An unknown yard, she sees from thence,
     here's boredom, madness or pretence,
     Farewell to you, my free existence!
     just now of wrestling with his shade,
     with mournful sound the secret shade
     the days grew shorter, in the glade
     the coolness of the sombre glade,

     that I prefer to Champagne's tide;
     And now the door is opened wide,
     of every funeral far and wide;
     tranquillity, and solitude --
     with The Well-Meaner10 on her knee?
     ``The house, the park... I'll go and see!''
     perhaps, though Phoebus warns, I'll see

          O Russia!
        I
     was an enchanting country nook:
     The manor house, in deep seclusion,
     before it was the golden play
     a park, enormous and neglected,

     it stood, defiant of destruction
     interior d?cor in the end
     both set him yawning just as much.
        III
     Oak-floored, and simple as a stable:
     a book of household calculations,
     {64}

     to pass the time was Eugene's theme:
     into a small quit-rent -- and got
     he was a menace, and a freak.

     but ladies' hands are not for kissing;

     good-looking, in the flower of age,
     freedom's enthusiastic dream,
     and raven curls of shoulder-length.

     by the cold world's corrupt finesse;
     In heart's affairs, a sweet beginner,
     the uncertainties within his heart;
     something to rack his brains about,

     He was convinced, a kindred creature
     with irresistible refulgence,
     shine out and bring the world to bliss. >2

     that fired his soul, to burn the same;
     of virgin fancy, and again

     through heaven's expanse serenely flying,
     of something vague, some misty clime;
     of many distant lands he sang
     when not quite eighteen years of age.

     feelings he valued -- from outside.
        XV
     youth is a fever; we must spare
     {70}
        XVI
     which, listening with some condescension,
     but scarcely understood a word.
        XVII
     But it was passion that preempted
     Onegin spoke about its flights
     who on a deuce, that famous cheat,

     reduced to sense, not without pain --

     with deep emotion through and through,

     this soul that glowed with virgin fire.
        XXI
     with tenderness he'd watched and noted
     by deep and shady woods protected;
     she blossomed in the graceful ways
     in deepest grasses, quite alone,
     {73}
        XXII
     to which so oft we've dedicated
     of secret pain... but it's now rated
     almost as good as a dim lamp.
        XXIII
     poetic in her simple pureness,
     in Olga everything expresses --
     take any novel, clearly traced
     once I too liked it very much;
     Reader, the elder sister now

     Tatyana3 was her name... I own it,
     even in our names (and how much worse
     culture, so far from healing, hurts us;

     the child prepares for protocol --
     repeats what her mama has taught.
        XXVII

     her little friends, Tatyana'd yawn,
     for she was bored by laughs and noise

        XXVIII
     whisper of breeze announces morning,
     In winter, when for longer time
     is softly, indolently sleeping,
     Tatyana'd rise by candlelight.
        XXIX
     From early on she loved romances,
     she fell in love with all the fancies
     he never took one from the shelf,
     by way of secret tome that slept
     His wife, just like Tatyana, had
     {77}
        XXX
     And not because she'd read him, either,
     Lovelace, or Grandison, or neither;
     about them -- nineteen to the dozen --
     loved someone else, not her intended,
     her feelings were far more inclined --
     and junior Ensign in the Guards.
        XXXI
     She was like him and always sported
     but, without asking, they transported
     her clever husband on the morrow
     in tears and violent tossing vented
     Then, plunged in the housekeeper's day,
     In stead of happiness, say I,
     {78}
        XXXII
     in grief that nothing else could mend;
     she found, in labours and in leisure,
     and ruled him like an autocrat --
     meantime she'd give the maids a beating
     but never asked her husband first.

     Meanwhile the news of Eugene coming
     they'd settled that some years before.
        VII
     to all this tattle, yet at heart
     despite herself, rehearsed the part:
     so fires of spring will bring to birth
     Her feelings in their weary session
     by pain and languishment; she craved
     her heart had long been overrun:
     {87}
        VIII
     ``this is the one!'' Ah, ever stronger,
     by magic everything instils her
     She hates a friendly voice's sound,
     Sunk in dejection, she won't hear
     their tendency to call, and sit.
        IX
     Now, she devours, with what attention,
     and all their ravishing invention
     embodied by the power of dreaming,
     and Malek Adel,4 de Linar,5

     ours was no Grandison -- not he.

     Lending his tone a grave inflection,
     showed one a pattern of perfection
     He gave this figure -- loved with passion,
     pure passion's flame, and in a trice
     due punishment was handed down

        XIV
     I'll catalogue each simple saying
     and tell of children's plighted playing
     and after jealousy's grim weather
     I'll make them spar another round,
     of ardent speech, that aching flow
     facing a belle I loved with passion,
     but now I've rather lost the art.

     profoundly sunk, Tatyana stalked
     the bear -- what next? -- behind her stalked.
     for hours alone; she walked and walked...
     her way; she passed, then as she walked
     Wildly the fearful laughter pealed;
     monsters the maiden stood revealed.
     the impatient conqueror was humbled!
     but suddenly a snowdrift rumbled,
     but no, my Moscow never stumbled
     and what came out? a hairy, tumbled,
     fever of rhyme: thereby he's doubled
     the pangs with which his heart was troubled,
     another, and his memory's fled

     the eager players are enrolled --
     and saved from being charmed or fooled!
     Yet once for him her thoughts had whirled,
     hymnal as, endlessly unfurled,
     but just then Eugene's pistol flamed...
     the girl he'd scorned in what he deemed
     and Lensky, left eye closing, aimed --
     he's host, that's obvious. Thus enlightened
     knowing the offender, he'd been frightened

     But I myself read my bedizened
     approaches Olga; Lensky's signed
     her bow, as calm and as restrained.
     her manner is no less contained;
     he watched the guests and, as he dined,
     has something low and unrefined.
     sweet words by which her pain was banned --
     for whom her passion has been planned
     don't let me stray in paths unplanned.''
     Who in that flash could not have reckoned
     was that calm brow of one who swooned.

     away, so cool, so unconcerned?

     just as she'd always been, she tripped
     her girlhood games; in them he'd shared,
     a treasure never to be shared.
     as something not to be declared,
     at any time he'd be prepared.
     in terms where not a word was spared:
     at twenty, was a fop inbred,
     perhaps no more sensations lumbered

     they nudged Tatyana, and each muttered
     no, even her eyebrow never quivered,
     our lives were flat, and what had fired

     can it be true, and firmly stated
     a bit provincial and affected,
     his bow was wholly unaffected.

     no boy, to fight or take offence --

     first flakes of snow whirl round and sink
     like Delvig3 when he's dining drunk.
     he sounds, in lyric frenzy sunk,
     in morning time he'd read a book...

     And just here, in the window-nook,
     and to that far and lonely nook
     his elegies flow like a brook.
     by ancient limes, or by a brook;
     where flows a little glittering brook,
     then Lensky moved his pawn, and took,
     coldness of wit; each note he took,
     would bless the form his fortune took.

     7 Heroine of Ozerov's tragedy Fingal.
     a novel, vague and superficial,
     over his neighbour's plain memorial,
     But let's return to our essential,
     of other's thought -- a splendid goal;
     his thoughts were on a distant goal:
     But he could draw a joking moral,
     so heartless and so detrimental,
     to bring across Lepage's4 mortal
     and to the vision of those mortal

     then from the Muse there came revival:
     and still exempted from removal
     Though long since Eugene's disapproval
     the subtle spouse was just as loyal --
     and the majestic, antlered royal,
     while floors would split from crash of heel,
     or cunningly create a quarrel,
     and though he liked a fiery quarrel --

     had killed his best friend in a duel;
     Lensky resolved before the duel
     Still blazing with resentment's fuel,
     was finding leisure's vacuum cruel;
     No hope! no hope! He leaves the revel,
     (like passion's dream, that other revel)
     Now, faced with this enormous revel,
     he whirls her through the wood... a hovel
     But how she jumped, when in this hovel
     who else? -- the hero of our novel!
     shows up through trees, all of a grovel
     we visit them, or without fail
     to face him now I feel too frail...
     and still within, behind the veil
     lift up the gauzes of her veil,
     sed alia tempora! The devil
     wishes his madness to the devil,
     installed in me a different devil,
     he'd got annoyed, the tricky devil.
     we'd better hasten to the ball,
     and in full brilliance shines the ball.
     on dance-floor, at breakup of ball,
     direct from shipboard into ball.
     swiftly decayed beyond recall
     she quite forgot -- began to call
     the threshold's thronged, wet-nurses call,
     whatever you may need, just call...
     Beds are made up; the guests are all
     like foliage in the rotting fall.

          Still for ever, fare thee well.

     no word came flowing from his quill;
     such stubborn brain, and vivid will,

     in play with her obedient doll
     then he presents her with the scroll.

     a humble cross, in woodland gloom,
     the girl remains there in the gloom
     far-distant heaven's vaulted room;
     clears in a flash the freezing room;

     a note from Lensky; in between
     In passion's sluicing rain they freshen,
     with deeds; that dunces now and then
     in lives that were just dawning then.
     to talk of this and that, but then
     were chanted, I remember when --

     the untiring city, where you've given
     Forsake, indulgent reader -- driven
     Up to the porch our hero's driven:
     to Eugene; nineteen to the dozen,
     she appears before him, grim and frozen.
     the rogue has got a finger frozen:
     are here untouched by fashion's reign,
     was one who raged and raged again,
     would not have recognized again
     On this we'll part; goodbye again!
     On this we'll part; goodbye again!
     after two minutes, off again,
     we sometimes like to hear again
     from waxen cell the bees again
     and looks out on the darkened plain.
     the charm of what was grave and plain.
     No, all in her was calm and plain.
     levy their tribute on the plain;
     she walked across a snowy plain
     a furious, boiling, heaving main
     radiance of Dian, sits in pain
     and records of a heart in pain.
     and rightly so, but now his pain
     her full account of voiceless pain?
     advantages of heart and brain,
     to hit the target: thigh or brain.
     God grant you took at least a grain.
     God grant you took at least a grain.
     on modish malice, coarse of grain
     To whom do you, from all the train
     to raise the safety catch and strain
     a dwarf with tail, and a half-strain,
     of jealous girls, devote its strain?
     to your loved ones? They do maintain
     but Eugene hasn't moved; for certain
     of hills has hid the moon; for certain
     in that new couch, no sleep for certain;
     days that are lost behind the curtain,
     round the dim river sleep; the curtain
     No sleep, beneath that silken curtain,
     and parts the fringes of his curtain;
     runs after what is sweet, and vain.
     no artifices of the vain...
     it hurts, he laughs, and all in vain
     He deemed, in general, letters vain,
     once more renounces world and din.
     with comedies of swarm and din;
     but salt; near the princess a vein
     whose serfs are miserably thin;
     he loves you... like your kith and kin!

     When Eugene's turn for salutation
     I pray God grant his soul salvation,
     what kind of thought, what observation,
     The kinsfolk in concerted action
     of his intent; and a reaction
     of childish pranks: a chilled reaction
     for nature's unadorned reaction
     The nervous-tragical reaction,
     the quintessential reaction

     with shelves of books deployed for action,

     Lensky all evening, in distraction,
     had long proved tedious to distraction:
     what dream accounts for her distraction?
     It's true, the magnet-like attraction
     But you perhaps find no attraction
     I gave no rein to sweet affection:
     with such a blissful, brief infection --
     Whatever in this rough confection
     Whatever in this rough confection
     the universe is all perfection;
     arrested by the sheer perfection
     on Eugene's lips. In his dejection,
     for him all sham has found rejection,
     and charming reverie's vain deflection
     the man of reverie and reflection,
     what holds her in profound reflection,
     in simple but sublime reflection,
     is lost in obstinate reflection;
     almanacs, journals of reflection,
     what held me was my predilection,
     To reading from this odd collection
     But, as it is, this pied collection
     He found them in some old collection,
     absorbed me in the recollection
     then on the leaves of recollection,
     you sought -- tumultuous recollection,
     you sought -- tumultuous recollection,
     the books then underwent inspection...
     Walking her horse in introspection
     but looks and talk took the direction,
     Dogs, howling, rushed in her direction...
     Reader, whatever fate's direction,
     She wanders on without direction.
     but where such hymns in my direction
     to undertake their resurrection,
     Tanya's distress had risked detection
     giving the lady their protection,
     there's far too much of contradiction,
     in dreams and cards and their prediction,
