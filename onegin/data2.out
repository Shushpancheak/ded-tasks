     But soft! You hear? A scowling critic,

     Lensky, that tragic victim, died...
     debauchery was praised, and studied
     he's dreadfully dissatisfied;
     If suddenly aloft she spied
     ``Who? that fat general?'' Tanya cried.
     she lacked her sister's beauty, lacked
     Eugene, at Olga's side, was racked
     for hours alone; she walked and walked...
     Wildly the fearful laughter pealed;
     and what came out? a hairy, tumbled,
     Meanwhile with pain her soul was girdled,
     A sudden clatter!... blood was curdled...
     The lady of the house has fled.
     another, and his memory's fled
     the samovar of evening boiled,
     beneath it, vapour wreathed and coiled.
     For what charade is he apparelled?
     Evgeny looks at Lensky, chilled
     ``Well, what?'' the neighbour says, ``he's killed.''
     whose heart experience has cooled
     and saved from being charmed or fooled!
     Yet once for him her thoughts had whirled,
     His hair was fashionably curled,
     he found all kinds of brickbat hurled.
     The jealous poet's gloom is lightened!
     Tanya's no longer quite so frightened
     But I myself read my bedizened
     to nobody except a wizened
     below the others who have signed
     her bow, as calm and as restrained.
     her manner is no less contained;
     has something low and unrefined.
     For several days she peaked and pined

     Or, as by Lethe's bank he slumbered,
     Her tender touch had never fingered
     however much her soul has faltered,
     1 Pushkin first wrote ``imperial portraits''; but this he later altered
     and nothing in her look is altered:
     no notice of them. But I've chattered
     if you come with me, they'll be flattered;
     Onegin, my good friend, was littered
     The aunts exchanged a look, they fluttered,
     I don't mean that she never shivered,
     our lives were flat, and what had fired
     both hearts to blaze had now expired;
     filled him with thoughts that swarmed and whirred;
     Beyond the stream there smoked and stirred
     on Eugene, he was deeply stirred:
     deep in Moldavia the abhorred,
     that sat above the stove and purred
     the silence when our talk had ceased!
     Like convicts in a dream released
     for long... for evermore. We've chased
     for long... for evermore. We've chased

     Unforced, as conversation passed,

     a haze in me, but I grew used
     to whom your hearts are dedicated,
     and Fly?nov, amply lubricated,

     but for the effect that he created
     in darkness in her room, or treated
     He's always with her: either seated
     The clock of doom had struck as fated;
     she fell in love -- the hour was fated...
     they buried Uncle, congregated
     its nullity I've always hated,

     Tatyana watched the moon, and floated
     on waves of far niente floated,
     to eat and drink, then separated
     his tale of youthful love, narrated
     the thought sank in, and penetrated:
     on dining-chairs are all prostrated;
     So glut yourselves until you're sated
     Seeing Vladimir had defected,
     The tomcat, mannered and affected,
     quite self-absorbed and unaffected
     as infant sleep, or the unaffected
     his strangeness, wholly unaffected,
     In French Onegin had perfected
     He sang of love, to love subjected,
     which held him silently subjected,
     the crown of marriage was projected
     the noise their rustic wheels projected --
     she'd never join the game selected,
     But who stands there, in this selected
     by fresh ennui as he reflected
     of light that flowering fields reflected:
     give for a bookshelf, a neglected
     give for a bookshelf, a neglected
     a park, enormous and neglected,
     Whenever nyanya had collected
     before Onegin there collected
     Once home, he brought out and inspected
     However closely he inspected,
     Often of course you'll have inspected
     that visitors must be expected.
     His father died; and (as expected)
     and the churchyard where, new-erected,
     and the churchyard where, new-erected,
     singing in chorus as directed
     But my Eugene that night directed
     once on the highway he'd detected
     Thronged by adorers, I've detected
     their masters' berries undetected
     I know, Godsent one, I'm protected
     by deep and shady woods protected;
     By now whist's heroes have completed
     No path to see: the snow has drifted
     He was too young to have been blighted
     above a stream the moon had lighted.
     his soul still blossomed out, and lighted
     And suddenly her radiance lighted
     Suddenly, from a crest, she sighted
     love's crown, delectable, awaited
     expecting winter, nature waited --
     she sang of childhood's fun, indited
     Where is the fire that once ignited,
     Winter!... The countryman, enchanted,
     Yet -- fear itself she found presented
     Sometimes a landscape's represented,
     she grew accustomed, and contented.
     in tears and violent tossing vented
     our disposition being invented
     a tomb, a Cyprian shrine's invented,
     Lensky of course was quite untainted
     instead the chance to get acquainted
     Between the lines of text as printed,
     Since earliest boyhood he had doted
     with tenderness he'd watched and noted
     A thought was born, and quickly noted...
     To harmless idleness devoted,
     But it was passion that preempted
     From that rough spell at last exempted,
     a foe -- our mood should be warm-hearted.
     a foe -- our mood should be warm-hearted.
     ``Poor Yorick,'' said he, broken-hearted:
     Outside the gate Tatyana parted
     sadly he mourned for the departed.
     but soon the ways we trod were parted
     Reader, I wish that, as we parted --
     Reader, I wish that, as we parted --
     Between them, every topic started
     at earliest morning out she started,
     Eugene would willingly have started
     So there she stood, forlorn, deserted!
     Now for the first time she's escorted
     Was she the Tanya he'd exhorted
     which smilingly your friend, supported
     but, without asking, they transported
     She was like him and always sported
     a hundred times afresh distorted;
     And long, as if through mists that spurted,
     Eugene turned countryman. He tasted
     till then had been dispersed and wasted --
     With reason, too: for when he'd vetted
     by heaven with such an unsubdued
     with grave goodbyes to the bereaved,
     the strophe over which I slaved;
     had long been wasting and enslaved
     by pain and languishment; she craved
     for maybe fortune will have saved
     as if some goal had been achieved.
     sweet old tradition was preserved:
     Russian pancakes were always served;
     and happy licence are allowed,
     by now his bride-to-be has wed
     at thirty, lucratively wed;
     a stride on Petrarch's path, allayed
     or Freisch?tz as it might be played
     and, hands a-tremble, Nyanya prayed
     Lensky has watched: his rage has blazed,
     and put a cross-sign on the maid.
     by nervous hands of a schoolmaid:
     nor his,2 who sings of Finland's maid.
     a masculine disguise to aid
     So my Zaretsky, as I said,
     Her eyes were opened, and she said
     stumblingly call to mind he did
     Still tumbling, devil, snake and Cupid
     Still in the porch, exhausted-stupid,
     on springtime grasses of the field,
     under the table's linen shield,
     from her Monsieur took on the child.
     beyond the grave we all must build --
     He was sweet-natured, and yet wild.
     times were when I was sharp and bold:
     Boston and ombre for the old,
     ``My sweet, my dearest heart, I'm old,
     Is he a Melmoth, a Childe Harold,
     We each have enemies in this world,
     ditties of our secret world,
     ditty of our secret world,
     and been as happy... as I could!
     in manifesting, as he could,
     spying my features, as he could,
     of calculated slander should,
     already stirred him as they should.

     Perhaps some secret apprehension
     over the note holds in suspension

     and almost swoons, and almost dies.

     and human words, and horse's stamp!

     and in flat calm I've found the stuff

     and looked at him without a word,
     and look, my cousin's come, Buy?nov,
     and look serenely on your beauty!...
     and magic nights. In headlong course
     and mileposts grip the idle sense
     and my whole life has been directed
     and nameless rivulet, that scene
     and not because she'd once preferred
     and now at last he saw the World.
     and now the crunchy snow is stripping
     and on her cheeks the fever stays,
     and, on the crosses, jackdaw hosts.
     and on the flames let fall unseen
     and on their marks has made them stand;
     and opened Schiller... but the embrace
     and pale, and fade without a word!
     and paler than the moon at dawn,
     and parted from her by their star.
     and part in kindness? Just the same,
     and parts the fringes of his curtain;
     and pay my debt in the same coin
     and plaits a piebald shoe of bast;
     and pledged to you, and firmly planned:
     and put our heart into a shiver
     and read my Apuleius keenly,
     and rest myself from earlier days.

     and sets her gently on the floor.
     and she, submissively, inertly --
     and should have played a different part:
     and shout, and make room for the pair.
     and shouts suggest a crowded wake;
     and silently he hung his head.
     and sleeping sounder than a rock.
     and slowly day begins to climb.
     and so he lacks the strength to mention
     and so in winter-fields will shiver
     and soon they bring her... a guitar
     and soon will day's bright tune be played;
     and so the harmless chat progresses
     and still exempted from removal
     and, still transparent to the view,
     and still within, behind the veil
     and stops his doleful heart from sleeping:
     and strip the forest round about.
     and swaggers in a red calpack;
     and swarming in his inmost soul.

     and tea and supper; there's an inner
     and tea's brought in. Instead of chimes
     and that embittered mind which boils
     and the Skot?nins, grizzled sages,
     and the blancmanger, then a fleet
     and then concludes: she loves him yet!
     and then it's tea that comes to mention,
     and then old cousin Pelag?ya
     and the poet, without a sound,
     and there at large he goes patrolling
     and there a tombstone says its word
     and the young city-bred newcomer,
     and those we sing for will be paid
     and though my muse may be capricious,
     and thought, a sleepy numbness steals;
     and thoughts of her were what inspired him
     and to Tanya, when he was through,
     and took two Petriads in calf,
     and to that far and lonely nook
     and to the vision of those mortal
     and trails alone around the wood.''

     and wakened Lensky by exclaiming:
     and watched a different world unroll.
     and watch him stubbornly bring low
     and ``what's your name?'' she asks him, speaking
     and when, by misty moon, the east
     and where Terpsichore alone
     and where Thalia, gently napping,
     and where he'd silently agreed.
     and where is love's tempestuous yearning,
     and where's her sister now? and where,
     and while the star still flew, she'd hurry
     and whiskers -- all of this it keeps
     and whisper ``Dunya, pay attention!''
     and whist, that's now so keenly f?ted --

     a rooster head, and on the twitch
     around Priam the much-respected,
     around her neck, or when for her
     arrested by the sheer perfection

     as battles go, I've not begun;

     as fresh as ever, for its graces
     as from their luscious hive go tumbling
     a shadow, null and meaningless,
     as if a cold hand squeezed her heart,
     as if beneath her, dark and rumbling,
     as if she'd been profoundly sleeping,
     a simple monument is built.
     a single thing to her. His head
     as in the nook he'd sit alone
     ask Tanya out to dine, and they

     a slipper, or a magazine?
     as much of banquets and the cork
     a soul that perished long ago,
     as pair by pair the dancers fly.
     a spirit strange, a spirit burning,
     assembly, silent and dejected?
     as something not to be declared,
     a stall, a kitchen and a fence.
     a steed responsive to the bridle,
     as when chill autumn rains surround us,
     as yours did, Homer, godlike lord,

     condemns the monde and its excitement;

     could they not laugh out loud, before
     council, and with profound head-shaking

     cows low, in the still nights of spring
     critics and their capricious vogues,

     he'd see his soul cool in its grate;

     he fell in love with darkest wildwood,
     he found Tatyana so attractive,
     he found too much that he regretted:
     he goes ahead and parts the motley
     he had conveyed some moral teaching,
     he has to bring the battle-case.
     he hears a voice; ``well, what? he's killed!''
     he informed this envoy diplomatic
     he knew too well that sort of scene.
     he laughs -- they all begin to chuckle;
     held in constraint by pity's touch:
     he leaves one morning the hermetic
     he leaves the house, calls for his horse
     he looks, and sees the hour of day --
     he looks, in sweet irresolution,
     helping the poor, or while I mended
     he murmurs: ``Olga's mine for saving;
     her Russian was as thin as vapour,
     her darling foot of its wet shoe,

     her heart speaks to her even louder
     her husband's or the world's attention...
     her journey home is overdue.

     her nerves, she leant on it her weight,
     her out-of-fashion clothes!... oh, mercies!

     he saw no point in staying on,
     he's called you out -- say, in your soul
     he scowls -- and the whole gang are still;
     he sends a letter, penned with passion.
     he sends, a second, then a third.
     he's first to toast her in the bowl,
     he's got consumption. In his anguish
     he's happy, yes, he's almost well...
     he's host, that's obvious. Thus enlightened
     he should have settled for disarming
     he's left sad footprints on the ground.
     he's lost his self-command, and crazed
     he's moved... you see him from the side.''
     he sounds, in lyric frenzy sunk,
     he's put belle Tatiana instead.
     he's racing millward like a bird.
     he steers her, nonchalantly gliding,
     he stoops and, tenderly confiding,
     he's up the steps, with heart a-quiver
     he takes her to a chair, beginning
     he trembles, knows not what to tell;
     he warns his man for duty, stressing
     he watched the guests and, as he dined,
     he whirls her through the wood... a hovel
     he would have found a normal fate.
     high time he should be on his way.
     his French valet, Guillot, is there
     his awkwardness, he's hardly said
     his bow was wholly unaffected.
     his converse gave Onegin pleasure;
     his dull, sick look, his dumb reproach --
     his foolish face; more pleasant yet
     his head upon her shoulder... blaze
     his humbly suppliant approach,
     his illness lends him courage and

     his nag has smelt the snow, and planted
     his nature would be changed and steadied,
     his neighbour entered at a rush
     his news has set the party humming!
     his pistols, laid them in their case,
     his pup to grace the sledge, while he
     his serfs rejoicing at their lot.
     his spindly, shaggy nag. As fitting,
     his sweetheart faithful to her grief.
     his tea with rum quite left behind,
     his thoughts were on a distant goal:
     his thrusting horns, and as he passes
     his virulence that made you smile,
     his weary head, and softly drooping
     his wit, according to the rules
     his young heyday's supreme employment,
     hoar-frost and sun in freezing weather,
     hold half the world still unreleased,
     hope that he's had no time to fashion
     how I interpret this expression:
     how are your kith and kin today?
     how envious was I of the waves
     how fearful, too, is my obsession
     how long is it?'' ``And since I fed
     how many follies were engendered;
     how many lines of verse, and themes
     how pleasantly the stages pass.
     how proudly, how divinely gleaming,
     how sad the scar of passion's knife:
     how sensuously her eyes are dreaming!
     how soon the bounds of rank and station
     how they remind me of your stem,
     how to engage in talk that drew
     how well she'd studied her new role!
     humbly I heard your lesson out?

     if, motionless, no life appearing,
     if not slow-witted, might have known.

     that moment, of a luscious pie
     that night, in secret, set for two;
     that not a syllable be uttered
     that nubile maid of riper age,
     that one be shot just anyhow --
     that on the world's staircase there waited
     that poisonous worm, despised, degrading,
     that rogue, backbiter, pantaloon,
     that she's ``ideal'', begins preparing
     that she's so trustful, and imbued
     that somehow that same day we'll meet...
     that soul without a moral tie,
     that spring with me has had its fill
     that's the morass, I beg you note,
     that stretched from Romulus in his prime
     that strikes him with such force and meaning?
     that table where the lamp has languished,
     < that there existed, for the indulgence
     that this of all things for a swain
     that, though polite, was clear as ice.
     that we enjoy equating chatter
     that wicked, loose-tongue chatterbox...
     that wit embarrasses the dull;
     that with him to the trysting-place
     that your proud glance is sure to take!
     that youthful heart. ``But now at least
     the Major's here: he's all the rage
the Neva.''
     the Russian for le comme il faut.
     the abstracted poet would bring forth
     the album of a country miss
     the altar flame's extinguished now.
     the ancients have gone stiff and cold,
     the answer's past all human viewing,
     the art he'd studied best of all,
     the ballroom drove me off my head:
     the bank, the immobile stream are levelled
     the barbs that envy's always spreading,
     the bear explains: ``my cousin's here --
     the bear has raised her in his paws;
     the bear let out a roar, and held
     the bear -- what next? -- behind her stalked.
     the beauties in their flimsy dresses,
     the best revenge one could desire.
     the big room, further, not a cat.
     the blaze of candles, and the trembly
     the bleeding tongues, the tufted tails,
     the bliss that fills me when your throbbing,
     the blood came smoking from the wound.
     the bloom has withered on the bough;
     the boring wives, the ill-bred men,
     the branches all are weighted down
     the branches of the oak with flock;
     the cabinet behind the door
     the carriage of the newly-wed.
     the child prepares for protocol --
     the children spoilt, the mad, the rogues
     the circumstances of his capture
     the climacteric of our life,
     the coach has reached its destination;
     the cold perfection of the sky,
     the cooks prepare the midday meal;
     the coolness of the sombre glade,
     the country cottages and hovels,
     the crash of plates and knives is blended
     the days that doom has measured out.
     the deeper in the wood, the more
     the doorway opened wide to meet her,
     the downy woods are greener-tinted;
     the draught whose blessings are agreed,
     the driver sits and cuts a dash
     the eager players are enrolled --
     the earlier griefs are what I miss.
     the early pealing of the bells
     the earth for him grew dumb and closed?...
     the elegy, grown paralytic,
     the enjoyment of a friendly drink,
     the expanse of fields, so wide, so lonely,
     the eyes of all, the hooves, the snozzles,
     the faces met with everywhere;
     the fear and rage with which I foam!
     the festal name day has begun.
     the first will never find fruition,
     the flaming roses of a cheek,
     the fleeting tenderness that stole
     the flickering tones of dress and speech,
     the floor serves Triquet for his nap,
     the foes, cold-blooded and unspeaking,
     the fools who sparkle far and wide,6
     the foreign words a maiden's passion
     the friends' salute she never hears
     the frozen corpse, drives off, and homing
     the full fruit of her heart's desire;
     the funeral monument explains:
     the giddiest hope, carefree and gay,
     the girl he'd scorned in what he deemed
     the girl remains there in the gloom
     the girl's attentive eyes are bent.
     the girl's pale charms, her loosened hair,
     the girls sing out the ancient rhyme:
     the grand barouche is on its way.
     the grand monde finds it out of place.
     the grey-haired nurse with kerchiefed head;
     the guardian angel of tradition,
     the guests squeeze closer to the centres;
     the hall's without a living creature,
     the hapless Phrygians all the same,
     the happenings of the previous night;
     the hare who from afar has seen
     the hat, the scowling brow, the chest
     the headpiece-text is thus indited --
     the heart and all its fragile dreams.
     the heart inside him seemed to shrink;
     the heavenly lights in glorious quire
     the highest circles are a bore.
     the horns, and the moustachio'd nozzles --
     the horrid nightmare must portend
     the horror of disgrace and crime,
     the hostess cries and, moving fast,
     the hour was late. And now from aching
     the household boys in noisy rout;
     the hunter in the wood will swear
     the impatient conqueror was humbled!
     the imperturbable princess.
     the infant year with cheerful greeting:
     the inmost thoughts that girls can hide.
     their breed would (some years after this)
     their cloaks; Zaretsky's measured off
     their hands are dipped in scarlet gore,
     their hand to grapple slander's cup,
     their hopes, their pranks, their dreams at night --
     their journey took them a full week.
     the iron figure3 on the table,
     their table, and their hours of leisure?
     their unattractive t?te-?-t?te;
     the jagged flint's pulled back anew.
     the joys of youth, that festal cup,
     the keys that opened up the hall.
     the kiss where youth and freshness gleam;
     the leather rein, to learn the tale,
     the legatee of his relations --
     the letter from Tatyana's hand:
     the level tenor of his going,
     the lies that in the press run rife,
     the linen stretched on the tambour.
     the logs; the wild ones have the floor;
     the lucky bard, and as he dozed
     the lust for blood drew them apart?
     the maidens all are slumbering deep.
     ``the mail explains the time he's taking.''
     the man of honour and of sense.
     the man of reverie and reflection,
     the man she feared and idolized --
     the man who laid her brother low.
     the meaning of an epigraph,
     the men confront them, face to face:
     the merchant's up, the cabman's walking
     the millions of two-legged creation
     the moderns rage against the old.
     the modesty of her condition,
     the modish Record Office clerks
     the moon; but in the darkened glass
     the moon in its azure of air.
     the morning after, a surprise
     the morning light no longer lingers,
     the murmuring Nereids recite,
     the murmur where the streamlet played...
     then Lensky moved his pawn, and took,
     then afterwards, alone, at ease,
     the needle, never had she lingered
     the neighbour... you must tell the brat
     then from his cabinet he'll pass
     then he began to talk once more
     then he'd implore a declaration,
     then, help me God, she caterwauls:
     then he presents her with the scroll.
     the nightingale's begun to sing.
     the nightly luminaries climb.
     then in the study's quiet setting,
     then later slyly he'd revile them
     then night comes on; the moon's patrolling
     then, on the last page, the suggestion:
     then quickly something changed all this:
     then quietly at last says she:
     then, stepping nearer, Eugene said:
     then sudden fear attacked Tatyana...
     then to the altar, to be crowned.
     the occupations of the morning.
     the odious bear still grunts and lumbers.
     the old dame wept her daughter's parting,
     the one who killed the youthful poet?''
     the only face to shake and pass
     the pangs with which his heart was troubled,
     the party waits. Seized with an illness
     the pillars of the turnpike-gate;
     the poet struck down by his friend!
     the potholes make the coach unsteady.
     the prejudices of the ages,
     the prince bring up his own relation
     the prince looks at him, and replies:
     the quintessential reaction
     the regimental band is coming,
the relative merits of the classic ode and the romantic elegy.
     there'll be a fight. For that I give
     there never fails a kindly greeting,
     there's a small window shining in it,
     there's crashing, rumbling, pounding, trotting,
     there's not a word she's understood;
     there's nothing can employ her anguish,
     there's yap of pugs, and laughs, and bustle;
     there was a softness in his glance:
     there was no trace to be detected
     the ring of marriageable girls --
     the rogue has got a finger frozen:
     the sad beginnings of his life
     the safest place for declarations,
     the same as any other day.
     the secret of her husband's measure,
     the secrets of the grave, the pages
     the shades of night within their keeping
     the shady wood, the talking stream;
     the shepherd, as he used to do,
     the shepherd sings of Volga's fishing
     the simple legend -- then a haze
     the sky is brilliant in its blue
     the snow from all surrounding hills;
     the solitude of woods and tillage,
     the source's chattering voice is heard;
     the spring invites you to the land
     the spring of honour, and the pin
     the stars, the moon -- celestial light
     the strangeness of her habitation,
     the sumptuous palais shines out;
     the swarm, the glittering mob that presses,
     the talk of guests when they appear;
     the tears in stream pour down her cheeks.
     the third day, wood and hill and grazing
     the thirst for work, the lust for learning,
     the threshold's thronged, wet-nurses call,
     the time to go has long since passed
     the tolerant Evgeny heard --
     the towers of whitestone Moscow beaming
     the trail the youthful poet followed
     the tusks, the corpse's finger-nails,
     the two foes stand with eyes downcast.
     the units are ourselves alone.
     the unmetric verses of tradition
     the untiring city, where you've given
     the vales dry out, grow brightly printed;
     the valley's dark. The forest lands
     the vital force gives them the shoot
     the war, the snowfall, and his wife.
     the whole thieves' kitchen flies asunder,
     the wild rose blooms, and in the covert
     the wine-addict adores the cup:
     the winter's ways are smooth as glass.
     the world and all its works, she wept
     they all have richly earned a pension;''
     they all have swarmed into the hall,
     they all still keep their old impress:
     they'd just enrage it with their dart.
     the year, his age, then: ``may your rest,
     they find her somewhat unexpected,
     they fluff her curls out in the fashion,
     they heap up silver with a spade;
     they kill the zest of rhymed composing,
     they managed to disperse the pack.
     they nudged Tatyana, and each muttered
     the young hostess, towards whom each
     the youthful votary of rhyme
     the youth of those past days in line
     they praise the Father of the world.
     they're all chained up in different fetters,
     they're on the dance-floor, waltzing, spinning.
     they're plunging, whirling, all but squatting.
     they rise and ripen and fall dead:
     they shared their days in deed and heart,
     they shove each plate, and every chair,
     they sit, they cross themselves for grace.
     they talk of her, of how and whether:
     they've moved around and been reseated;
     thickly the exclamations fly.
     thinking: he loved me, and in strife
     thirty-two steps with great precision,
     this Grandison of hers was splendid,
     this angel, this proud devil, tell,
     ``this is the one!'' Ah, ever stronger,
     this was the science of that passion
     those walks amid the gloom and calm
     those words where love, without condition,
     though I'll come back to him, yet clearly
     though Menelaus, in Helen's name,
     though he's unknown, there's no suggestion
     though some support it with good grace).
     thought, day and night, and thought again
     though there he's no more to be found,
     though we... don't shine in any way,
     though what's romantic here I simply
          thou, my Svetlana!
     threats, vows, and simulated fears,
     three carts -- traditional procession --
     threw Eugene at her feet -- she stirred,
     thrives to this moment, in a station
     through baseness of the soul that he,
     through gloom and mist; and there came streaming
     through him is sweetness' self. In grumbling
     throughout the boredom of the hours --
     throw meadows into muddy rout,
     thumps as the balls are pressed inside
     till Moscow, meekly on its knees,
     till he at last was summoned down
     till now our language -- proud, God knows --
     time was, in evening hours of leisure,
     time was when morning's breeze was swaying
     to Eugene; nineteen to the dozen,
     to Eugene's letter, word for word.
     to Evgeny. Oh, God, she'd never...
     to Moscow settled in a trice.
     to Olga's face, he whispered low
     to aim, at steady, even pace
     to ask of you that you transcend
     to a soir?e. ``My God! to her!...
     to battle further with my passion;
     to bellow out: ``she's mine, she's mine.''
to be mentioned in so offhand a way''.
     to boom, to flash across the sky,
     to bring across Lepage's4 mortal
     to burn -- and then by force of reason
     to captivate, and then to fly.
     to clasp your knees, and at your feet
     to come back to the hall alone
     to comfort her in all her woes,
     to cool my glances and my tongue,
     to crack between them; for a while
     to demonstrate some signs of reason:
     to do them all is easy game.
     to drain, on credit, bottles three.
     to draw a breath, around her staring
     to dreaming given up unduly,
     to drop all that old-fashioned mumming;
     to each and every raving feast
     to encase herself inside a layer
     to ensure that till next time our image
     to expose to Moscow fops and Circes
     to face him now I feel too frail...
     to fashion's absolute dictate,
     to feasts and fun this winter past;
     to fresh grandparents every day.
     to gentlemen on every side
     to give you honest explanation.
     to happen long ago, dear readers,
     to hear him howl: ``that's me!'' You'll get
     to heart. And in his misted gaze
     to help her from the other side;
     to her flower-garden, to her novels, --
     to her glass porch; pursues her round
     to his Tatyana, yes, he's racing,
     to his disputing and his cursing;
     to his mysterious tree the snake
     to hit the target: thigh or brain.
     to hope that even once a week
     to infuriate a clumsy foe;
     to institute a new regime.
     to it the people's blessing never
     to kiss Armida's lips, or seek
     to know you, swooned, and in a second
     to lie down at her feet like slaves!
     to lift her skirt up; still she's flying,
     to lift his pistol up. A span
     to liven with a silk atour
     to meet a black monk, or if crossing
     to meet his thirsty lips... What daze,
     to meet the unhappy poet, skipped
     to me her best in-quarto tome,
     to mourn for Russia's gloomy savour,
     to my young days, it's time I turned
     too faint to stir a further pace:
     too long, against my inclination,
     too long he's hoaxed us high and low...''
     too pale, too thin, but on the whole
     to pass for an affected freak,
     to pass the evening. No? then tot
     to pass the time was Eugene's theme:
     to pine away from passion's thirst,
     to pranks and jokes of earlier date.
     to put on chains for him, and steady
     to puzzle out with some precision
     to raise the safety catch and strain
     to reasoned talk, no dull hearsay,
     torment of pride? And why's he come?
     to roar of banquets, din of brawling,
     to save the honour of our land
     to scorn the men with whom he deals;
     to see life as a ritual play,
     to see my kin, and in the end
     to see the grave, and shed a tear.
     to see you, faithfully to follow,
     to sing of others must imply
     to smother her dear feet with kissing.
     to sob out prayer, complaint, confession,
     to speak; believe me: of my shame
     to spoil loose paper by the ream;
     to steal away her neighbour's light
     to stem the bloodstream's wild outburst;
     to talk as if with heart unwrung,
     to talk of this and that, but then
     to talk to her, but language died.

     touches obliquely, but with speed,
     to undertake their resurrection,

     towards the Larins' and arriving
     towards the simple urn beneath;
     toward the neighbouring valley's river.

     when he arrived; not in the slightest:
     when hourly we ourselves betrayed it,
     when, in pale sky, the stars' procession
     when in the park, in the all?e
     when little notes come on a tray.
     when night patrol's a perilous calling;
     when, on the plain, green herbs are massed,
     when our Zaretsky met his eyes.

     where admonitions are pronounced,
     where are distress, commiseration?
     where are the reveries this time,
     where a sharp nail has made a dent.
          where can we find your equal?
     where civil treacheries are rife,
     where did that glum eccentric go,
     where dwelt this child of inspiration,
     where every day a bloodstained shade
     where fate had fixed our confrontation,
     where flows a little glittering brook,
     where folded arms are tightly pressed.
     where her security's complete.

     where, in a cab, and furious hurry,

     where's the high aim, the ardent sense

     where two old pinetrees stand united:

     while she's from top to toe surveyed;
     whispered by heart a note addressed
     whisper of breeze announces morning,
     whisper repeated to the crone.
     whispers some ballad of the hour,
     whither does all my yearning tend?
     who all his life would garner praise
     who can combine it with the free
     who'd sit, and at the end of play
     who early died as die the brave'' --
     who else? -- the hero of our novel!
     who, in good time, would calmly get
     who in the country spends her summer,
     who in the dark came flashing through
     who'll clap an entrechat, or scoff
     ``who loves you more than I, let's see
     whom shall we never find a bore?
     whom thirty centuries have adored!
     who never learnt how dreamers babble;
     who never scorned the social rabble;
     whose heart on dreams was wont to thrive,
     whose serfs are miserably thin;
     who swaggers in with the reply.
     who walks with sorrow, and with danger,
     who was it that you dreamt about?''
     ``why, Olga's younger, and she's bedded.
     why, at the thought, my husband's mother
     why fight what's known to be decisive?

     will halt her horse and, gripping tightly
     will in a flash decide his lot.
     will reach, and past the tomb's compound
     will the benighted reason smile,

     wishes his madness to the devil,

     with Guillot; while pourparlers last
     with Olga, all have pierced her soul;
     with Tolstoy's2 brush, or decorated
     with a consumption, they've relied.
     with a first click, the catch is tried.
     with all our hearts, and who require
     with an avowal just as artless;
     with an obeisance I'll hand over...
     with any torture so exquisite
     with a quick look perusing lightly
     with balm of prayer my torn and rended
     with bended knees a windmill dances,
     with broods of children of all ages,
     with care Zaretsky stows away
     with custom, love would fade away;
     with deeds; that dunces now and then
     with deep emotion looks about
     with demoiselles of riper age;
     with draughts from love's enticing flask,
     with every different kind of rabble...''
     with every sort of home possession:
     with eyes aflame Onegin rises
     with eyes of love, with greed to swallow
     with fire from every cross of gold.
     with fond caress? whose adoration
     with foppery and too much starch,
     with fright, she hears the approaching bear;
     with gown and slippers; tearing hurry,
     with heart that's grown unused to praise,
     with her own forests and her meads...
     with his forefathers would seem better;
     within her bosom to abate,
     with irresistible refulgence,
     with jealousy beyond all measure
     with lampions studded all about
     with lies and jokes that packed a punch:
     with lines to mark where they were sleeping...
     with love and comfort in your meaning,
     with neighbour Lensky, the deceased.
     with old Anisia. The next day
     with our Mamas, and a sensation
     with our poor girl was kind and good;
     without a goal on which to fix,
     without an elegiac frill,
     without preliminary feeler
     without surprise or rage... his laden,
     with parks and mansions, open up.
     with passion and with shrewd obliqueness
     with perturbation and with worry;
     with pleasure on his vengeful act.
     with pots and basins out of mind,
     with puzzled and confused regard...
     with recent fortune, vainly waited
     with shelves of books deployed for action,
     with spinning noise and senseless flashing
     with storm and tumult in his head,
     with tears, in quarters of the maids:
     with the grand general in her wake --
     with the pink glow the snows assume
     with the resounding chime of glass.
     with the unmistakeable sideview
     with this the hero of my tale:
     with thoughts of him in ceaseless round.
     with tufts of snow; and through the lifted
     with visions of enchanted night,
with which XXXII ends, is Pushkin's own contribution, a sample as it were of
     with whom your thoughts are so obsessed --
     with work at home; but when he'd gone,
     with years no more to meet our gaze?
     won't even cross their minds by stealth...
     works where contemporary man
     would Hymen bring us -- blooms that might
     would be allied to him by fate;
     would fill Tatyana from afar
     would have been all that we required!
     would have divined the tender, shrinking
     would leave her dithering and tossing.
     would not have recognized again
     would on those evenings guess the fate
     would say goodbye and drive away,
     would settle, on the morrow morning,
     would talk, keep silent, laugh, then frown --
     wound that had seared my Tanya's heart!
     yes, even there its triumph grows.
     yes, focus on them your lorgnette,
     yes, in that spring-time, in low-lying
     yet, as each rule has its exception,
     yet dared not trust what I could see.
     yet he fell out of love at last
     yet people's malice and suspicion
     yet, truthfully and not in chaff,
     you acted well, that dread occasion,
     you age, and life's just grief and sadness...''
     you'd made appearance in my dreaming;
     you'd not so much as know the name,
     you find the country godforsaken;
     you help him to an honoured fate
     you in my arms on gingerbread?''
     you left no steps that could be tracked:
     you'll never leave me to my fate.
     you'll read: here's Pradt,7 here's Walter Scott!
     you'll recognize him soon enough, --
     you loved the opulent contact
     you made me drunk as one could ask!
     young poet, be for ever blest!''
     young traitresses by the platoon,
     you object of my guileless ditties!
     your Zeus, your Cypris, your whole band
     your advent swamps me in its flood!
     your battles, lawless and atrocious,
     your chorus, is it dead for ever?
     you're really going? Well, I'm sad.
     your feet, to pale and waste... what rapture!
     your grief would fail to touch my heart,
     your heart some self-restraint; for each
     your heels will squash the ladies' toes! >
     your heroes, raging and ferocious,
     your icy look, your stern dissuasion,
     your loved one, honourable reader!
     your matchlessness, to seek to capture
     your presence aches, and in my blood!
     your pride, some answer, or in truth
     yourself too long from social life.''
     your tears would flow -- but your emotion,
     your words, and in my soul to explore
     you see the two in uniform...
     youthful, who ripened in his time,
     you took an honourable part --
     you've paid insanity its due.
     you were the first ones he forswore;
     you won't find that quite so much catch...

     But friendship, as between our heroes,

     although one in no manner shares
     The crush, the heat, as music blares,
     Europe's most finely chiselled wares
     and jam in jars, and household wares,
     across the drift-encumbered acres,

     Tatyana looks, her faintness passes:
     the inevitable silly asses,
     Each others' and their own successes,

     the skyblue eyes, the flaxen tresses,
     the footmen sleep on the pelisses;

     Onegin comes, and makes excuses;
     Along the fronts of darkened houses,

     of old-lime hospitality.
     the guests are feasted, good and hearty,
     go off to sleep quite hale and hearty,
     is this -- one sees from here the party:
     devote to whist an evening party,
     a ball here, there a children's party;
     You'd never class her as a beauty;
     Take Olga's shoulders now -- the beauty!
     I've known too many a haughty beauty,
     inexorably wed to duty,
     All flourishing; they send their duty.
